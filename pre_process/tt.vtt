[Music]

7
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,720
and and you know the people that are
gonna go up against you right you know a
bloodthirsty they are like nothing's

8
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,450
gonna stop them nothing stuff if you're
on the way well you better get out of
the way before it's too late

9
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,810
what made you decide to handle on I
taking a break and a leave the way that

10
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,200
you did which was to be pretty open
about what was going on and also you

11
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,000
didn't seem that concerned concerned
about what that meant for your longevity

12
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,500
as a team daughter asks for a lot of
time it asks for all your time more or

13
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,340
less
and if somebody doesn't want to spend

14
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,920
their time doing something well
everybody should have the freedom to do
what they want and yeah we set ourselves

15
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,120
this crazy goal or winning the
International so once that's achieved

16
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,250
what do you want to do and then well a
lot of us wanted to play right away and

17
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:06,990
Anna decided that he's not ready to play
like he again wanted to self-reflect

18
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:13,800
spend some time at home and that was
that and how how meaningful is it to be

19
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,430
able to come and play ti and play in
front of a different audience with it

20
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,570
being in Shanghai and in China for the
first time there's so many things about

21
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,900
this ti that are different from last
year's it's a new audience where you

22
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,410
were a different team probably I mean we
grew we're gonna play against 17

23
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,420
different teams that are very good at
the game

24
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,739
the Chinese audience is there I've
always admired how the fervor like

25
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,280
they're gonna root for the teams that
they're gonna decide to root for as most

26
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,880
likely gonna be the Chinese teams and
they're one of the very few audience

27
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,590
they're also roots against the teams
that are trying to defeat their their

28
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,739
favorites and it's rough sometimes he
gets rough I remember my first

29
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,820
tournaments in China sometimes it was
overwhelming I was it was getting to me

30
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,090
I was like well but they're actually
chanting against me or they're booing me

31
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,110
or it has happened not always but it
happens it's part of it it's competition

32
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,170
right I mean let's say we had a
tournament in France and this would
happen I'll be like yeah you're cheering

33
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:08,549
up
you know tre cheer me up see I'm Francia

34
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:12,989
that's not gonna happen I need to get
over that one day man one day we just

35
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:16,320
keep the game alive long enough yeah all
the other nations will fall and France

36
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,239
will be the last one standing and you'll
get

37
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:24,780
doesn't need to be a world weird noble
we're just talking about the feasibility

38
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,800
of the LTI happening France which is
good options nothing more that's about

39
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,159
the only option that we have is there
anything else that you want to add to

40
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:38,879
fans of OG and fans of dota just in
general just about where we are right

41
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:44,520
now sitting here getting ready for TI 9
just remember why you sat down to play
for the first time and why you keep

42
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,139
sitting down to play I mean maybe you
forget along the way I have forgotten

43
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:54,990
along the way but it's a game that I
truly love and I'm sure that I'm not the

44
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,789
only one there's so many players just
the good parts again focus on the

45
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:03,719
positivity enjoy the games enjoy your
teammates don't queue for the next game

46
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:06,690
if you're in a bad mood and you know
it's gonna be a bad game q if you're

47
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,659
looking for the fun if you're looking
for something good if you're looking for

48
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:13,680
that nice game or nice experience and
that doesn't mean winning some of the

49
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,340
best games are still spent losing and
yeah some people get caught up in that
as well play for play for fun have fun

50
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:28,620
enjoy it thank you guys yeah welcome
play for fun says the flower himself in

51
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,279
his amazing advice it is great you
shouldn't he do that playing for

52
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:37,469
millions of dollars also great if you
can do that I definitely advise that as

53
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:41,490
well as we have got a match coming up
that is millions of dollars but I don't

54
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,870
think these teams are looking at it like
that we got eg vs. og coming up but

55
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,210
let's put that aside for a second
because there's been another competition

56
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:56,520
going on and that is the one for the
Arcana will it be ogre will be win

57
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,259
Ranger let's find out

58
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:22,629
[Applause]
[Music]

59
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:29,990
select you get to keep your job I am
very happy for you

60
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:52,669
she got trashed oh boys

61
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:59,099
fake boys thick boys for life I love you
ogre I love this community we're always

00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:06,900

all of us today this blessed day thank

63
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:15,960
you yeah all right we actually have
Jake's reaction live as well for when

64
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,029
the vote was done

65
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:33,020
he definitely is a very very happy buddy
now the question is will he would he
have actually quit yeah he would have he

66
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,470
would have yeah the one thing I know
about slacks is like the only thing that

67
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:43,340
really affects him is the community and
I think you would have been seen as like
a sellout or something like that so he's

68
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:52,310
got to do it oh god I've made a lot of
problems I've never ate talk to your

69
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,750
doctor he's like yeah you can't do that

70
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:02,270
yeah I'm gonna say you know I voted
windranger but I'm happy either way cuz

71
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,680
okay I rather have a lot of ogres in my
in my games been a lot of windranger

72
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,910
well have I got the tournament for you
shiver the International 2019 you're

73
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,450
gonna see nothing but ogre the zero is
dominating the charts I don't know what
kind of concept are gonna go with three

74
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:26,210
heads smart Oh ger can be very
terrifying I can't wait however we have

75
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:31,910
to wait for a while and we also have to
talk about something coming up we have

76
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:38,510
oh jee vs EG coming up and that matchup
you know we're gonna break it down in

77
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,240
case you're new to donut which I know
there's a lot of people just tuning in

78
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,160
for the first time and there's a lot of
history between these two teams

79
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,930
Oh multiple fronts but a tsunami you
want to break down the most recent one

80
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,640
the most obvious one the one that
everyone always knows of it's a super

81
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,120
major trauma if you let me take you back
a little over a year no tell fly

82
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,210
brothers-in-arms for as long as you
could imagine they played a honda gether

83
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,930
they came into the DOTA community
together they briefly separated when
their separate ways they came back

84
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:16,550
together and then it all fell apart two
weeks before two week before before the

85
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,250
super major right after you sell
Birmingham which if you haven't seen it

86
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,150
I highly recommend another documentary
that og recently released which kind of

87
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:28,430
shed some light on it but two teammates
almost nearly family members with how

88
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:34,400
close they were they separated and after
that it's it's just been just been drama

89
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,480
ever since not necessarily but that's
the way that we like to look at

90
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,459
yes better OG one Tieg got third they
both did extremely well Arizer no you
know they would have done not as well if

91
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:52,240
they were the original og spot or well
it is time for these two former friends

92
00:09:52,240 --> 00:10:00,339
to take the stage here at the
International 2019 let's get them on

93
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,399
[Applause]

94
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:15,080
[Applause]

95
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:27,110
[Applause]

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:33,409
[Music]
[Applause]

97
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:40,699
[Music]
evil geniuses will take the stage here
as they get ready for us an important

98
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,630
match winning here would guarantee them
top three finish and we know that they

99
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:56,120
the top three and get to first but they
have to beat a top foot first

100
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:02,920
Oh Jean had been there
will it be their road bucket again we're

101
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,490
gonna find out
that's oh gee and we'll take into the

102
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,730
pond

103
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,820
[Applause]

104
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,249
[Applause]

105
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,139
[Applause]

106
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:54,690
oh gee taking the stage here indeed to
the defendant

107
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,520
during the opening ceremony policing
that ages

108
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:06,379
[Applause]
as a remembrance of that achievement but

109
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:16,879
they are not done yet they would like to
be the first to TI's in a row would that

110
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:22,309
be a tremendous tremendous achievement
that would be all that would be unheard

111
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:26,990
of it would be we have never had that
before we've never had 4p champions let

112
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:30,079
alone back-to-back yeah it's crazy I
mean most people going into the tea is
that they just want honestly don't look

113
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,199
that good it might have been honestly eg
after ti5 right they gwyne to ti6

114
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:40,910
looking okay and now oh gee they're so
close to top three one more match right

115
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,930
it's pretty insane yeah well there's a
lot to talk about when we look at these

116
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,860
two teams and obviously you know you got
the no-till and fly story but I want to

117
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:54,199
focus on something else you got top so
you got to mail to winter kids that
basically have one TI first try you know

118
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:02,029
you come to TI a young kid ain't like
okay you know what I'll take it they

119
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:05,689
they both did and they're gonna face
each other how important is this matchup

120
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:10,220
for you in this game so in Korea in
StarCraft we actually have a term for it

121
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,300
it's called if you win the first major
in your first ever try you're considered
a royal roader your royal roader yeah no

122
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,860
one else's what you you are a royal
roader it's like the highest distinction

123
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,069
there's not many yeah it means like one
of one you were the best at the time

124
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:29,660
it's such an impressive feat too because
often times like at T eyes you want that

125
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,949
veteran experience and here both of
these guys were able to win it in their

126
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:36,410
first go
it almost warps your perception it's

127
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:40,550
like ah that was easy you just kind of
stroll in and win you're like okay I

128
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,339
guess that was no big deal and I feel
like that's stuck with them since

129
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:47,779
especially for a guy like sumail I think
that gave him unheard of confidence and
I feel like for Thompson it's done

130
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,970
something similar cuz the way that this
guy plays and he's completely fearless

131
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,779
yeah it was how dominant they did it to
her I like sumail was definitely the

132
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:00,529
best player at that ti and tops and on
pills say I mean a lot of people want to

133
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:05,029
go with Anna but Thompson very rarely
like played poorly and that is insane

134
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:10,040
they didn't just get carried so somebody
but time I meant said recently he said

135
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,269
Thompson is probably like the player
that might lose his Lane the most but

136
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:18,089
he's also like the player that will just
when you the game the most as well he

137
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:20,730
does it all
he does all the little things correctly

138
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,510
like he plays the game the right way his
laning mechanics are like whatever

139
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,470
because he plays very weird heroes that
often loses Lane but he'll make the game

140
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,890
winning place that seems highly
reminiscent of the critiques people had

141
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:36,420
about Ana's early era into og whenever
they were winning majors and stuff like

142
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,830
that they're all just like I just keeps
losing but somehow they keep winning and

143
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,220
that's sometimes what a team takes
clearly no-till and stab know how to

144
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,070
take advantage of a player who
sacrifices himself like that yeah you

145
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:52,500
want to know about early og days crit
was on that yes true that he went to Ti

146
00:14:52,500 --> 00:15:00,920
with og didn't do too hot and of course
he jumped ship early the early one yeah

147
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:05,339
they come on over but you know I'll be
here warming the seats yeah he's done

148
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:09,660
he's gone through a crazy transformation
coming out from Captain and then
focusing again on the position for real

149
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:16,529
rule tsunami he attained quite a bit of
abuse early in his captaining days as

150
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:21,510
well every single time that eg would
show up to TI obviously the bar was set

151
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:25,680
at PPD captaining and you're like he's
not as good as PPD than what's eg doing

152
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,130
but he kind of came into his own he has
relinquished the captaining role which I

153
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,640
think was the best room especially with
fly coming in that dude is far more

154
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,329
accomplished and it allows crit to
focusing on just one thing which is just

155
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:40,500
being a beast of a four position now
when we talk about og and when you see

156
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,029
them play you've watched all the
documentaries there's one over arching

157
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:51,360
factor it is confidence and comfort and
they are just very happy to just play

158
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,920
ready shift friendship sure you want to
go there that's fine but it feels like

159
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:03,990
that this ti so far that has been the
major factor in terms of women lose sure

160
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,800
the dota you know the dota we see is
great but I feel like that we kind of

161
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,980
see you know the the auto system kick in
and then everything else like you got a

162
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,899
deal with the pressure yeah it's tough I
think og it's just crazy like after

163
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:23,339
after win after loss you can just
continuously see it doesn't matter them

164
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:27,270
and they don't lose very much so it's
hard to see him after a loss but it was
funny I actually took up my headset

165
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,470
whenever they introduced to
you know like who the Chinese crowd

166
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:43,050
really likes and honestly sab was I
could not believe it I'm not sure it was
pretty crazy I was surprised I thought

167
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,269
it'd be like no tell and it's it's
interesting because the four positions

168
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:50,579
actually have the least amount of
collapse on both teams I don't know what

169
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:54,180
that says maybe they like their four
positions more but it was pretty crazy

170
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,220
these teams are similar in the sense
that you got our TZ

171
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:05,189
and you got Anna both being big
cornerstones of the squad and then you

172
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:09,360
got jarek's and crit are kind of like
then where you know that they're the
support but they're also like the

173
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,069
supporting role they're not being as
flashy as some other four supports I
mean know that they can do it it's just

174
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,670
that the way they're playing right now
it might not be the case yeah I think

175
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,160
some of the heroes are like where's
Earth Spirit they're both known for

176
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,760
their Earth Spirit you just don't really
see it that much anymore I wouldn't be

177
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,260
surprised
it might get pulled out in this series

178
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:32,600
honestly what do you think is most
important for this series tsunami I

179
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:38,520
think that as easy of an answer it is
what are you gonna do about oil what are

180
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,350
you gonna do no one has a solution for
oh geez I have a solution

181
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:55,350
what's that you ban it I mean if we're
being serious I think you you have to

182
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,770
ban the IO and the mag and you have to
pick your poison between some plugin and

183
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,890
chant a Chan like that that's just how
it is to me you can't give them those

184
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,010
two here well how stubborn of a captain
do you think fly is because a lot of

185
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:09,900
people are letting game one go by we're
done with the Bo ones and bo3 territory

186
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:15,120
now you can afford to let maybe one game
slip by I think I think you you don't
risk it we'll what do you think I feel

187
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,470
like you definitely don't because I
think a lot of this game is gonna come

188
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,919
down to like the mental fortitude of
both teams because there is so much

189
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,730
history behind both of them I could
easily see a team losing Game one having

190
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:33,179
a hard time recovering trying to do too
much to recover in a game too so I feel

191
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:37,169
like getting out of the gate early on
and just trying to get a quick win is

192
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:40,890
sort of gold here yep
and it's a mental aspect you talk off as

193
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:46,679
well and we know that oh gee actually
this ti they have incorporated an extra

194
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,660
member to their team they now have the
professional eSports psychologists that

195
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:56,400
formerly helped astrology for people
that don't follow astrology of Travis's

196
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,870
to see us go team and they struggled
winning for a very long time and then
they incorporated this psychologist and

197
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,840
they won their first major just like
that just getting into the right mindset
it's so important yeah I think this

198
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:13,549
trellis might need to get that coach
back they've been on a crumble lately

199
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:18,990
yeah and it's crazy they really are just
one game wave or sorry one series away

200
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:24,570
from that top three possibly a full-on
rematch against LGD how crazy is it what

201
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:37,610
are the odds that og has the near exact
path true in the upper bracket 17 20 18

202
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:43,230
is pretty crazy no no it's it's a little
bit especially because most of the teams

203
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,100
right this it feels like the first tee I
wear teams that even did pretty poorly

204
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,179
just stayed together they're like you
know what let's do it what it right it

205
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:54,030
complains we keep shuffling teams let's
show them one more year and let's see
what happens obviously for a team like

206
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,660
VP didn't go too well but now you have
the eg and even og even know they had il

207
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,490
TW for a bit but now you're back with
your full roster and let's go let's go

208
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:10,169
indeed and for for og of course we
remember the group stages and I'm sure

209
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:13,710
EG remembers the group stages too
unfortunately for them they started out

210
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:19,799
pretty weakened in the second day the
first match up for them was against og

211
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:24,690
it was the og eg special when we were
having big you know expectations of this

212
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:30,120
series and then it was a bit of a
thrashing yeah it was actually funny I
was watching boba and socks the coach

213
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,059
were just both watching on the same TV
and anytime like eg would start making a

214
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:40,740
big play bowl buff to start clapping
non-stop and then the fight would just

215
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,010
straight up turn around and you I I
looked over and of course the the og

216
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,580
coach did the exact same thing just
started clapping and like you know that

217
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,299
they're literally right next to each
other like oh I'm getting out of here

218
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:55,530
but talk to me about these two coaches
because they are so different we didn't

219
00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:00,269
have socks cup with og
is TI he's with the team now he's been

220
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:03,869
with the team for for a little while
what do you think is the main difference

221
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:08,189
we have obviously Bulba drafting tsunami
but not so much yeah I think boba is

222
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:13,709
more of like a judge jury executioner of
the eg drafts I don't really think that

223
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:17,519
obviously he talks with fly and stuff
like that but the way that it seems like

224
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,389
he sits in the pod he puts on the ad
said he's clicking the buttons a lot of

225
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:25,799
the times whereas with socks August II
he has said in the background and said

226
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:29,849
but had a long story to history of being
oh geez coach so it's more collaborative

227
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:34,619
on the OG side at least based on what we
see outside but we may be able to see KC

228
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:38,939
and talked to her for a little more
insight alright well I know you want to

229
00:21:38,939 --> 00:21:42,419
make a point we'll but you gotta wait
with it you gotta wait with it until

230
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:47,309
after the first game of this blockbuster
of a series let's get in that to the
draft

231
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,140
[Music]

232
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:04,020
[Applause]

233
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:16,400
[Music]
oh gee had a really confident group

234
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,539
safety this year last year they faltered
Iggy's on that pathway a little bit in

235
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:26,510
some ways what do you guys expect to see
here fun just fun man fun lots of

236
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:30,470
battling I think could be could be a
really fast game and it could be a

237
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,990
really long one I don't think I don't
think the middle ground is really what

238
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,750
I'm looking at here if it's for this one
I think it could just go really really

239
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,179
one-sided on either one of those fronts
you know

240
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:41,570
oh geez definitely done that sometimes
reason yeah in their last series had
some crazy 20 minute wins with with

241
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,770
abusing the IO strat but not this game
I'll getting banned finally I think the

242
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,740
I think eg that I've looked at majority
their games and they have much longer

243
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,559
games and the OGIS kind of just been
steam rolling a lot right cuz they had

244
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,950
such a successful group stage but yeah
that's the one thing I'm concerned for

245
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:01,400
eg is just getting caught caught off
guard a little bit here and just getting

246
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,340
the kind of run over so I think that
they want to be able to take the fight
to og because og is gonna look to battle

247
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,419
a lot especially from watching how
you've been playing a lot of the farm

248
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:13,700
game I think right now eg expected you
just been SD but the elected open so I

249
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,450
think they're talking about how they're
gonna all bullshit cause SD has been the

250
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,620
hero of the tournament and eg has picked
it all up and been in Naga siren in the
first phase is basically unseen right

251
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:26,240
now so they're just clearly trying to
learn a lot of tier 1 heroes through

252
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,539
that what you think it I think they're
just targeting et's top heroes right

253
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:32,510
they love their Nagas aren't on our TZ
and they absolutely love sumail slash

254
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,940
strike so there's a sec okay these are
super comfortable for them get rid of

255
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,650
them
yeah this is exactly what I was thinking

256
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:41,659
too so unlike the LGBT game series the
three supports left elder titan ogre

257
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:49,730
Magi shadow demon take the SD I think
that's the best support right now take

258
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,059
it sdn enchantress are in the pool right
as the enchanter point Shen if you want

259
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:58,190
to go for if you want to go for that
oh yeah and chanters has been very like

260
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,940
contested yeah these two teams it's
definitely something

261
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,340
oh gee likes as well they would have
picked better pick out through yeah
definitely I think the hotel is the only

262
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:09,350
position five that's comfortable in the
enchantress usually when it's run by

263
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:14,240
fives on the other teams they have the
older playing it because they have to be

264
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,799
playing it like there it's got to
counter to be putting on a position

265
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,270
three so that's why it's played as a
position 5 but I think whenever ITC good

266
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:29,090
here on position 5 enchantress he he
look so comfortable on that hero so

267
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,240
there are ways to beat in lane it's
typically a super strong laner mccann

268
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,360
pressure pours that's a little bit of a
turn here and hoji

269
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,380
they've got something up their sleeve
plant here like this is like not at all

270
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,950
what we expected to see based on the
draft earlier today I think I saw them

271
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:46,730
run this one even if I was cast in the
game I think these new years I think

272
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:50,180
they do Lane DS and it was a seven
playing the trees Jaron explained this

273
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,970
grim stroke and they put so much
pressure on the safe lane they were just

274
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:56,000
inks well this treant protector we just
beat on them and then grim stroke would

275
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,300
sit in the back and throw constant nukes
and it was actually pretty insane how

276
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,720
much they were able to do and it's a lot
of magic damage right off the bat from a

277
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,290
grim stroke and you also have a hero
even girl that can prevent enchantress

278
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,920
from getting her heal off not only with
the stun but with that phantom that can

279
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,140
be really obnoxious if you don't get
your heal easily as

280
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,290
sometimes you can get burst and it can
be really nice as well if you have
overgrowth you could just essentially

281
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,880
lock her in position when some other
stuns potentially prevent her from

282
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,320
breaking the sounds first be a great
catch hero definitely gonna be helpful
for setting up kills good at punishing

283
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:30,440
and catching heroes like treat as well I
don't want to create signature heroes

284
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:36,680
yeah I really like the og two picks
against enchantress it might not have

285
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:42,410
damage but I think it comes from -
damage control Hobson's and Ana's heroes

286
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:47,900
so the control is definitely there
the tree and the green stroke I've seen

287
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,020
them run a lot of eye cream stroke with
the I think they were the first ones I

288
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,720
want to say at the MDL major when they
were doing grim stroke with phantom

289
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,480
assassin and I know they had Magnuson a
couple those games so he might not see

290
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,030
that happened but it's great versus the
enchantress we've seen the rise of the

291
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,420
PA as well and just the combo the inks
well with that quick phantom strength

292
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,630
again on top of targets is definitely a
devastating one that I've seen them run

293
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:09,080
a lot they really do like that combat
yeah it sounds pretty good another team
earlier in the group or in the main

294
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,550
stage used juggernaut I think at the
safe lane as well against or that can

295
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:16,640
work well because at least then you can
spin the guaranteed damage possibly

296
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,080
killer but it's difficult to lane
against her we see a lot of carries
that'll just kind of zone out of the

297
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,980
lane at some point when you should kind
of let her take the tower but

298
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,430
potentially og could defend that if they
depend on how much tree armor they get

299
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:32,420
since she doesn't push very well tree
armor a little bit of defense there it

300
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,510
could prevent her from snowballing
Molina's Hart

301
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,570
wondering if you want something like I
think they want at least some strong it

302
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,240
five-position hero what I'm looking at
is actually especially after that last

303
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,510
game even those FY playing it jakirah I
think that's one of the heroes we steal

304
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:48,690
played a lot versus trained protect
because it's really slow wind up and it

305
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,840
just secures the lane because tree can
sometimes just crush your safe plane so
think that could be a possibility and I

306
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,430
think it's a good hero that works really
well for eg with the Earth Spirit in

307
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,980
combination yeah I like that a lot
attack speed slows against anybody that

308
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,710
tack slow and the other thing tons of
damage over time it basically nullifies

309
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:07,130
his armor if you ever once use it to
save people mid game

310
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:14,910
batrider ban a potential matchup counter
against enchantress or just good for the

311
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:18,840
lineup here what do you guys think I
think they were maybe thinking about
I'll position on five batrider from

312
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:25,020
Voltaire because it provides though it's
very strong II mean yeah five that

313
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:29,660
writer so they have ran into quite a few
times the group-stage primarily

314
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:33,870
interesting a notary is very good at to
use like Muir heroes that are not
traditional position wise what is very

315
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:41,460
good at the leaning it's always
surprising to you I think one thing that

316
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,460
og does is they basically forge their
own path I feel like that's one of their

317
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,150
keys to success you could maybe say it's
like comfort they're happy that kind of

318
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,120
a thing but I think it's also that even
a tournaments that they lose they're
always doing their own thing they're

319
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,850
playing heroes in ways that only they're
confident doing everyone else tries to
adapt to the meta feels like og is

320
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,260
almost always trying to set it and I
think that's one huge advantage they

321
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,020
have coming into ti I totally agree I
mean right last year when they're just

322
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,470
busting out offlane Magnus no one else
is really picking that at all offlane

323
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,560
Treves the same exact kind of style tops
in playing all these a kind of bizarre

324
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,350
heroes that he just is really
comfortable on in the mid lane and in

325
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,110
terrible mid matchups to where like
every other teams like hope we can't

326
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,950
have a bad mid matchup he'll lose the
lane then go create space for people to

327
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,830
rotate against them all the protect his
team I had a feeling this one is coming
in the third paycook we're saying that

328
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,050
grim stroke PA combo they they just love
it and it's such a good matchup first

329
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,930
enchantress and it's gonna give you that
late-game insurance immediately right

330
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:34,500
off the bat so this yeah they love this
combo I've seen them doing so many times

331
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,000
and I was saying an MDL major we saw
their look three times

332
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,750
do you think it's good enough without
mag though Megaman the first phase we

333
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:45,740
saw the PA mag earlier today with a
different series even against the

334
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:50,930
Enchantress but game's gonna have to get
our own farm or is she just gonna do OD

335
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:54,050
things and just fight constantly
I think fighting constant I think they

336
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,290
could still get a steroid right the ogre
is still in the pool right if they do

337
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:04,400
want to go for it that that is a good
way to protect the lane I mean it

338
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,660
certainly can help but I I just don't
think that bubbles by itself is gonna be

339
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,230
enough personally okay cuz you're still
gonna have to fight farming native no

340
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:16,370
matter what right like yes you could go
like deso or something like that and hit
creeps at decent speeds but if you're

341
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,530
jungling for long periods of time now
that og does that that much I guess I

342
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:24,380
just feel like it'll be a detriment
although the gears that they're up

343
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,460
against all very low armor so it's
actually looking like a pretty solid da

344
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,140
game right now at least once she gets
BKB

345
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:42,710
see I'm just really strong Lane support
for mg you can secure creep waves really

346
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,950
easily
the downside though is that I think

347
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,220
she's gonna get run down I do not want
to play a cm if I'm against a grip

348
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,030
struck Tree Lane that sounds awful -
sounds really painful and even against a

349
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:56,480
phantom assassin if I'm leaning against
that and I make a mistake or get out of

350
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,510
position feel like it's gonna be I'm a
vulnerability

351
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:02,360
I'm much slower than them they're gonna
be able to get on top of me but the

352
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,960
bright side is much more mana for all of
the EG heroes and that should make their

353
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,600
laning stage just go better and let them
at least put pressure on that's right
that's what I'm seeing at least when I

354
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,350
see the earth spear and the enchantress
picked up it's looking like eg does not
want to just like sit back and farm in

355
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,050
this game they want to be at least
posing a threat usually while which is
very good at like even though they pick

356
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:23,990
these newer heroes they all like aim the
same thing they want to create chaos and

357
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:28,700
bring the other team into the third
temple and I think with Aegis picks they

358
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,430
I think they want to match that
aggression and the tempo all these

359
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:35,930
heroes can fight really early on content
raise her spirits yeah so far yeah

360
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:41,090
totally agree with that they're the
Earthshaker picked up so now I mean
there's the lineup is looking pretty

361
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:45,650
flexible just which one they would do on
a prioritize it's more than likely gonna

362
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:50,810
be I guess it's probably gonna be the
chair exertion right is it's gonna be no
tail on the room stroke I would assume

363
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,050
so
they're gonna do that dual Lane I guess

364
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:57,350
with the PA or maybe run some like aggro
kind of Lane with the tree-ring stroking

365
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:03,710
the PA and I hope they got a shaker and
food stroke and he a couple different

366
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:06,080
things
I assume it's gonna be no tailplane the

367
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,430
grim joke we saw him do that the the
other day as well yeah he's gonna be the

368
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:13,340
counter Lane pusher or shaker is also
gonna be able to help out with that
so if they can counteract a lane push

369
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:19,460
that you'd use pushing out the it'll be
really nice they pick the TV into the

370
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,940
shaker so but they're more so trying to
match the PA right just that high armor

371
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:26,270
carry that doesn't have to worry too
much about a pH is jumping University

372
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:34,970
you down it's also too right yeah how do
you feel the TP right now have you I was

373
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:39,010
thinking I was think I was 50/50 on this
hero altar today

374
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:44,080
I think peach lgt PPG game one with TV
and they look pretty solid I was

375
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,280
thinking like the shows too slow for
this meta yada yada yada but it didn't

376
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,690
seem like it I think what easy wants to
do is like a four plus one Smurfs cannot

377
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:56,140
be on this like hyper aggressive mid
that can fight with them early on with

378
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,910
the rest of Aegis heroes where are teeny
just sits back and farm up it's called

379
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:06,340
the Battle of TB versus PA I'll be kind
of surprised if PA doesn't go battle for
you because his funnel for a while if he

380
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:14,010
doesn't they could make it a little bit
harder for og to fight in the early min

381
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:17,860
me talk I think Thompson's gonna want
something that it just provides a lot of

382
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,560
magic damage and even potentially push
right now I'm actually looking at the

383
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:25,240
pugna I know he's a huge fan of the hero
I believe the last time they met up he

384
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,390
also was playing the pugna it's a very
good versus t be great versus

385
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,780
enchantress as well can definitely
something to set the pace and put
pressure on it it stops it what about

386
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,630
Zeus this looks really good Zeus I've
been wanting serious if we haven't

387
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:41,290
gotten too many and Ivan where or I mean
if we're gonna get it it's one of the
all Thompson Zeus right that's actually

388
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:47,260
very trans TVs yeah all these like weak
heroes I think he got banned out in

389
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:52,300
their last year's as well as the v ban
so nice expand I do want to like point

390
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:57,610
out that smell is it's gonna be having a
rough game Plus tops of all the counter

391
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:02,290
picking this whatever it is gets taken
out hold on looks fucking it looks

392
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:05,320
really good now yeah
PG was definitely missing lean push

393
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,520
earth spirit can't push lanes very well
enchantress camp push lanes almost at

394
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,330
all cm can and TV can a little bit but
they definitely need at least another

395
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:16,990
hero that could also facilitate that and
it's more nukes more stunts that help

396
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,860
them kill the PA in the in the early
payment oh they're gonna go for the tops

397
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,980
in invoker instead also a great way of
being close to running around the map

398
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,370
and make space right I think that's his
plan just he's gonna be the chaos maker
he doesn't care I lose my lane I don't

399
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,110
care I'm gonna move around the map and
just try to shut down our TZ on this
tower blade and just constant aggression

400
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:37,180
to make honest base I mean that's the
story of tops in a nutshell I think it's

401
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:41,500
a great hero to buff the PA slightly
towards PA favor against the P versus T

402
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:46,180
V okay well what aspect of it gives him
the favor is it just like yeah like

403
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:51,370
crazy like what really yeah
alright well that is the draft but
before we jump into the game we're gonna

404
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,970
have the last word with gunner so I'm a
mid laner I'm gonna focus on the mid

405
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:01,450
lane both of these teams
neither mid laners to have a good game

406
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:05,470
eg with sumail he's always there tempo
center he's gonna carry the game in the

407
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:09,820
first 25 minutes to get our tourists
some space art easy on his TV he's gonna

408
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,179
farm up the jungle smell is gonna be
rotating with his team running around

409
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:17,889
pressuring lanes and taking powers on
the side of Ag Thompson is usually the

410
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,190
tempo creator he's gonna win his lane
and he's always gonna rotate first and

411
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:25,570
he's not gonna worry about having to
carry as he has n on his back both these

412
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:30,129
teams they have the two Earth Spirit
garlic's they have credit mjx eg having
quit with the earth sphere in this game

413
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:35,260
I think they're gonna have the ability
to kind of rotate around early he's

414
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,600
gonna kind of pressure the mid lane so
I'm gonna be a little scared for this
invoker I'm Thompson to be pressured by

415
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:42,908
this Earth Spirit he's gonna maybe get a
little pressure as tower might be killed

416
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:46,149
earlier with the sea dragon at five
minutes I think there's me a lot of

417
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:50,440
fight the TB and the PA are both gonna
be farming I think this might game go a

418
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,120
little late there's gonna be a lot of
big fights

419
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,360
I think our two casters Toby on that
cinder and are gonna be the two bigger

420
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,970
carries of this game ah isn't that so
nice you know we've got a carry you
thanks sensei no problem I'm small I'm

421
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,180
light now I'm actually I come on back
packable yeah I've gained weight so
that's perfect there you go great

422
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:13,210
transparence we're gonna get faces done
since we're ready to go right now

423
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:17,200
oh gee they're the same and of course
you start with no G draft you think

424
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,710
everything's gonna be normal but I got I
got a thing to break to everyone at

425
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:28,150
heart that is not a support es that is a
three-position es slayed by seven no

426
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,550
tell we'll move on to the trampling
Viktor just for a little bit of

427
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:33,740
interesting fights because og can never
conform
only that exactly we were talking about

428
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,990
oh is it gonna be a scepter Ian or is it
going to be a sub shaker and a Jarek
strand but they spoke it out completely

429
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:44,600
putting no tail on a hard five treant
they think that this brim stroking

430
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,290
position or can have a huge impact on
the game and a possible reason for that

431
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:52,070
could be thick rim stroke acts in this
game being a really really powerful

432
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:55,369
agony meas against terribly creating
that illusion when he's used

433
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:59,030
metamorphosis it can deal serious damage
and something we've seen out of OG in

434
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:03,050
this tournament so far is they're really
good at doing porky mechanical stuff

435
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:07,010
like having these weird creative new
ideas where you use new stuff that's in

436
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:10,730
the game the IO Agra nemesis new the
grim stroke agony missus new so I could

437
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:14,660
definitely see that being the line of
thought for them here if you cycle I

438
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,619
love what gunner said keep an eye on me
that is where stuff is going to be

439
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:26,800
happening just in case you didn't know
eg look into my eyes what do you see

440
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:34,250
they plant the flags but I didn't scare
oh gee or EGA away from getting to ruins

441
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,730
at least so I guess they planted the
flags on one side only I was actually

442
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:41,150
waiting for them to do what they did in
the first series get you a costume this

443
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:44,110
space-age is like oh this would be
fantastic oh gee that game was done

444
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:47,990
better they started off with like four
flags all planted around it around one
bounty room but let's have a chicken

445
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:55,310
belly so as we had now won a quick one
minute toxin in Berga and he's going the

446
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:58,460
course to begin with we'll see how he
transitions the battle against the veil

447
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:03,230
it gives us an aggressive plane up on
the top Hannah and no doubt they've been

448
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:07,640
Dulany together for absolutely ever but
Ichi they bring three if at first who

449
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,060
doesn't succeed if you bring everybody
pushing Anna back under the town where

450
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:19,280
the metamorphosis damage he's actually
gonna have another fender bender that's

451
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,610
a good way to do it if you're eg and
this is one of the biggest benefits of

452
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,280
enchantress as a hero is that you can
leave her alone in the start against

453
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,150
displaying this I don't see them killing
her down here with seven Derek's but at

454
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:33,050
the same time Jarrett's can't leave
because several lose the lane so eg with

455
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,109
the right read on how to get the lanes
to begin with but get them off to a very
nice start here the witness entry went

456
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,480
down yep
now this Yaris coming cause son he's

457
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,869
gonna have to work with them and a big
initiator gone once again is easy so got

458
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:48,140
a little bit more time to get that range
damage in but now lose attention to
Nortel consumables are going to be the

459
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:55,490
order of the day for ergy volunteer
Topton he saw a large battle against
the colds that were pushing back they

460
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,600
have rotated Derrick's taco what this
will do now is that note rs4 will have
almost a full level advantage against

461
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:07,190
set bottom early on or at least a decent
one

462
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:11,000
and once enchantress gets level six this
Lane is not inhabitable Earthshaker

463
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,520
anymore so oh gee his top lane when you
rotate like this you have to win it or

464
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,810
any choice to ensure that Anna feels
somewhat happy up here yeah actually

465
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:24,200
getting some CS would be would be a nice
way they will call it I'm loving

466
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,250
Thompson's semester like talk to
literally requesting some ale come and

467
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:31,790
fight me I'm not even getting us out
there's only one coming out some male

468
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:40,430
able to hit these back back sons missing
up Celts foots fine Thompson underneath

469
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:43,420
the team or their sir

470
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:51,450
I was gonna say gaben but focusing
person everyone's I spoke at the hubs

471
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:55,560
this is a huge start for eg honestly
they offer good cold snap from Thompson

472
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,860
will at least stop half of the region
rim wants to high fight with some else

473
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:02,280
Millville no - so at least there's some
some friendship in the mid lane

474
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,110
Sibella bring his bottle it comes the es
roll in from trip they kick a little bit

475
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:11,160
up top to Thompson I think just sends
them up in the am for a quick moment to
engage

476
00:39:16,069 --> 00:39:20,519
Sousa mail is winning myth mature
enchantress as far as winning bottom for

477
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:23,970
sure
and this top lane is currently RTC far

478
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:27,059
ahead because of that first blood
advantage as well so fair to say right

479
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:31,769
now that eg are ahead and all free lanes
and I shall gonna be promote G they're
trying to get in on fly lovely new

480
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:40,890
cosmetic I love this when you scale up
our Canora every time it levels up all

481
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:45,480
of your allies have like an animation
for rolling balda in front trip well off

482
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,809
the target and it's OG trying gets a
little bit of space storytelling

483
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:57,750
stunning up trip for tomorrow good
protection so the role misses but artis

484
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,510
is the one having the best time
regardless even if these spells miss a

485
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:04,349
little bit Bochy seemed unable to make
their own aggressive moves and artis is

486
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:08,910
Justin I'm creeped after creep PA lets
her see us right now 15 for free it's
actually pretty good

487
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:15,119
from onna so far till miss lane I'm
loving watching this mid lane I can't

488
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,430
even take my eyes off and I should be
looking at the top lane cuz it's a
trialing up there but tops is just

489
00:40:19,259 --> 00:40:25,230
living on either a prayer or quarter HP
baby bars it just refuses to move back

490
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:29,250
out at this lane I'll bring us out he
keeps getting clipped on ventilation

491
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:33,240
rinrin Vikrant you get a rolling ball
turret thompson side set quickly with me

492
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,550
critical concept of tornado him again
the veil but the slave did they gonna

493
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:44,330
reach to reach Colton on cloud nine this
is how this mid lane is going to be some
male and Thompson will be trading on

494
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,310
stuff in Boca wants to trade so he can
make use of the cross orbs and Samia

495
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:53,510
wants to trade because he can kill with
an ally and that's the second kill here

496
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:58,220
in mid now some mail off to a really hot
start you know I thought that before and
then Thompson's Monkey King kicked in so

497
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:05,720
it's definitely a different style of
game there was definitely an iron and

498
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,280
magnus and in that series as well they
also just go on think about another line

499
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,940
number one on the CS right now is
actually said he's been running this

500
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,150
bottle on the bottom plane he's gonna
try and control of both the five-minute

501
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,640
bounty runes as full does not don't want
to let that happen

502
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,960
it's a sample back off when you see
Creek already rotating over and s boy it

503
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,470
looks like he wants to try and Kontest
okay except didn't want to fight for it
so that's three runs for you genius

504
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,080
respecting the rotation out of kripp saw
him on that observer award in the bottom

505
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:40,280
area that crate was coming so his TP at
least secures that rune and now now I'm

506
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,950
really curious what steps gonna do here
it's actually the thing I'm most curious
about in the game now because from my

507
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,920
experience this Lane will be completely
unplayable for shaker ones enchantress

508
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,560
is level six the only thing you can
really do is take creeps with fissure

509
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,980
every time you try to Millia crate with
enchant totem you will take two or three

510
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,580
impetuses your way and it's just not
feasible in the long run so what is he

511
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:01,670
gonna do he's pulling the wave for now a
little bit was bit probably pulled her

512
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,120
in Laguna plated up with the veil is the
first laser

513
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,540
EMP tornadoes amel can lose a lot of
mana the call stuffy still just got

514
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:12,220
enough to get into top stupid living
album it has arrived and Thompson will

515
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:17,080
survive the first lacunar of this game
it's very unusual that you see a trans

516
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,740
girl living on fly he's back again
demands the five Laguna bikini survivor

517
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:24,910
for the Gulf do your actual alright it's
a good stroke in a stunt now quit caught

518
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:29,560
on the wrong side of the tracks nice
turnaround for Archie took six minutes

519
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:35,050
but now they're off the boy off the mop
one arm and no till he's ready to fight

520
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:39,010
fly on the rune but no cell doesn't have
lead receive he's one zero to build

521
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:43,480
extremely defensive strand build I'm not
getting even that one bit one skill

522
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,050
point to help in the lane but focusing
on how much can I help the other lanes

523
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:50,620
with that living armor do you think the
living on the build up is also hello
bowling ball to down to was the bottom

524
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:57,370
like t-rex is under attack
like tram between s4 is full script but

525
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:00,220
we saw Archie when they played the
trains before they're always looking to

526
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:03,910
repair their towers how does art easy
actually take these house if you level

527
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:08,290
up living on a very early on how hard
you have to commit as a terribly to

528
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:11,290
actually bring down the tower that's
actually part of the brilliance and this

529
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:13,570
terribly picked because first it the
obvious thing is that that's good

530
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:15,850
against the PA right you have high armor
so you're good against these
hard-hitting physical attacks but the

531
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:22,150
second part terribly does a really good
hero at forcing down towers from half or

532
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:26,560
full to zero so he can deal with it if
they group up and make a team move it's

533
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,010
one of the best heroes against treant
protector in this early stage of the

534
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:32,500
game as a carry you can't really ask for
anything better than that

535
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:37,840
yeah they will still lose that t1 tower
on bottom place either plan some enemy

536
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,140
admit okay okay sorry I don't know those
characters so I can't tell you what they
are but there's probably some deep

537
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:45,870
meaning to this Gerak's

538
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:52,000
okay helping to be had here popular acts
potentially killing the courier on the

539
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,360
way back over the t1 tower dropping s4
was just able to force the issue

540
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,210
Naruto is watching RTZ rotate over but
he's burned a large portion of this

541
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:05,880
metamorphosis
it's a such an early Midas race for he's

542
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:12,300
going to be rich this game
7:30 - with boots and Basilius that's

543
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:17,280
it's really really good times for us for
and you look at the CS chart all top

544
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,330
three sitting on that eg side and the
shaker was doing well on the start I
think quite a bit of his CS is probably

545
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,820
jungle creeps and now this again this
bottom lane is he going to be able to

546
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:36,090
mark as far as moving so he tornado just
post pushing smell back a little bit

547
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:47,880
further but Ana's still doing well and
this top lane do we know how important

548
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,930
it is for G to give on a good game and
his game looks solid right now sitting
on the 50 CS minute 8 same as the

549
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:58,830
terribly they've both level six so both
of these heroes are having a good sync

550
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:01,590
good game and are happy the only
downside for honor is he doesn't have

551
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:04,920
like that Impala buff up he's used to so
he's having to build into the battlefury

552
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:10,470
on the phantom assassin just to still
keep finding that farm rate jerax is
hoping for something on bottom lane

553
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:16,520
that's got a lot of damage to work with
now completing at the phase boots

554
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:20,250
potentially able to run down some of
these years and cure Ike just need to

555
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,580
start him off so there's the inks well
okay that's maybe not exactly the way he

556
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:28,530
planned to do that and that was that was
not the right target and now steps kind

557
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,050
of trapped behind the tree lines Fritz
wondering if he can get some help

558
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:34,950
let's head now he's gonna find him
doctor the totem follows up with a
pitcher echo slams just for good measure

559
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:40,920
and drip tanks - a lot of it raindrops
help out with that but they'll still

560
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,030
take the kill that was a lot harder than
it needed to be for urging

561
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:48,960
yep and they don't get any structural
damage in here it looks like they're not

562
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:54,030
going to hit the tower but if the kill
it all helps gotta find what you can as

563
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:57,300
og right now is the your play making
potential as is talked about by the

564
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,360
panelists mainly coming from Thompson
but since you got lost explained by a

565
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,440
bitch the tempo is it's not that high so
at least you can use cream stroke with

566
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,960
shaker and well they're still hitting
the tower I don't recommend you want

567
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,840
some what it feels like that it should
but they're gonna finish the tier 1 and

568
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:21,330
then TP down I think you can this damage
is taking forever without the creep wave

569
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:26,310
so maybe they were ok with it
the wasting time at Nortel he actually

570
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:30,840
came underneath the observer water pump
under the bottom room so flyer was just

571
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:35,490
waiting for the attack to come in from
top subscribing to me and Thompson's
gonna walk through the same Ward that

572
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:41,070
note L just did you know exactly what
Thompson is up to and with him starting

573
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,920
to play between mid and bottom there's
they're absolutely not depending this

574
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,690
hour now therefore it did Alex them it
takes them so long but you know slow and

575
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:52,920
steady eventually think he'll get it if
nobody comes down here checks has been

576
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,400
pushing this tower for like a full
minute and now this each group is going

577
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:03,690
to come in and help them finish it off
the last length s force attacking into

578
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:07,140
the t1 tower of it it's the last
remaining tier one town for her Jean

579
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:11,700
they're really having trouble
controlling the map area but that the

580
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:15,420
only her G sacrifice heroes in the early
game it seems the t1 tells the next

581
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:20,880
thing on the menu for OG 30 L can't come
close he's in range of the Sentry s for

582
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,810
doing a good job not to reveal the fact
that he can see him nor reacting in any

583
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:29,070
way but now the creeps move towards if
no teller realizes they can see me in

584
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:34,740
fact not one not sure but 3 sentry
Ward's had to be planted in that mid
lane just to see things but it's well

585
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:40,200
worth it they got the biggest tower of
the game and there was no fighting from

586
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,350
OG because trans is only level 5 so they
didn't have the overgrowth they didn't

587
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:47,580
have the soul buying both supports from
OG sitting on those level fives when EG

588
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:51,440
supports her level 6
such a huge difference in power step now

589
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,220
phallus really good timing on the
aftershock now get the duffel fish is
done out as well but that's for

590
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:59,510
intensive up step count make it to the
trees where he was probably hoping you

591
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:06,800
could TP away to safety for 11 shooting
but it will not happen and fly if the

592
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:12,470
tip back to Seb Seb he seems to be the
monster of the memes on IG like it's a
little bit of a rebuttal

593
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:23,869
and actually well fly that was maybe a
little short-lived though she have come

594
00:48:23,869 --> 00:48:29,240
back find me indeed
hey stead is that an earned charge it is
that's big keep an eye on invoker's

595
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,400
vessel charges in this game it's the way
they're gonna kill the Enchantress until

596
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,359
s4 has a counter item that is the one
way they can kill her outside of using

597
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:42,650
the PA for the hardcore physical burst
because he's because of his grace out

598
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:46,339
he's actually going in for just the
dragon lens to begin where the nerves

599
00:48:46,339 --> 00:48:49,369
could be the full horror game pike but
they're looking for initiation

600
00:48:49,369 --> 00:48:54,349
yes rolling forward Thompson and that
purpose speed haste rune is up 550 on

601
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:58,789
the board and s4 being watched finder
tell they know he's coming in from the

602
00:48:58,789 --> 00:49:01,609
sides I don't know how much he can get
away with the concepts about trying to
get his own stunt the soundest a

603
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:07,789
mysterious fella hitting every ability
Phoenix the fact movement is possible in

604
00:49:07,789 --> 00:49:12,829
fact Eric will die too s4 no job for the
armored car for flying and stops letting

605
00:49:12,829 --> 00:49:17,539
a guard to here is down for G this is
not the Queen Chris dodo we've expected

606
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:21,740
and already seen from them this
tournament think the the game so we saw
in the main stage yesterday was also new

607
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:27,529
be giving og flat out their best fits
they gave them IO and mag and eg just

608
00:49:27,529 --> 00:49:31,549
come in with better preparation they
know exactly how they want to approach

609
00:49:31,549 --> 00:49:35,029
this first game and they're looking
great so far I find it funny how Anna

610
00:49:35,029 --> 00:49:38,569
and RTZ are literally not getting
involved in anything they're just

611
00:49:38,569 --> 00:49:42,260
they've been playing tough both of them
for pretty much 13 minutes straight not

612
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:45,410
moving across the map are actually not
sure RTC might have been part of the
foot

613
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:57,490
one of the sizes on one the other way is
fine time is blank reveal or said become
busier on khenpo just days with your

614
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:04,030
feet wet way to go away from the spray
hitting the condo in the pimp the double

615
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:18,760
stone from smell may be a little extra
space trouble with a capital SAP that is

616
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:24,250
the most ambitious to peak of the main
event I think next ralina with light

617
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:28,030
stuff very ready baby is like oh there's
a nice blink if you want to be out of

618
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:31,840
matter right baby there's a chance it's
a good blink reveal but at the same time

619
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,330
you would have loved to get a core
killed you got the two supports you got

620
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:37,480
the maiden and the shaper with your echo
slam you got a little bit bloodthirsty

621
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,690
on tops and starts chasing and Thompson
was kind of lucky to stay alive there

622
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:44,770
too he almost died too as far and you
just you see the problem they have with

623
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:48,580
this enchantress the only way they were
four heroes against the chipset and she

624
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:53,140
was phaser locked off and it wasn't even
close like they were tempted to try for

625
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:59,320
it not possible without the gear the
vessel will change things but it's not

626
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,290
there just yet for Thompson it needs
another 200 for same with the battle

627
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:06,130
fury for Anna maybe he saw is getting
involved after this is able to arrive

628
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:10,480
the wind probability is keeping it nice
and close 5149 that's what we want to

629
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,490
see we've already had an amazing day of
Dora - let's keep the streak going late
into the shanghai night the 15 minute

630
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:23,590
bounty runes in ten seconds looks like a
two for two yeah should be EG will claim

631
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:27,330
the north her Jeep will claim the south

632
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:39,479
Oh golly balda outdoors top drink
whenever crackin anna TZ doesn't have

633
00:51:39,479 --> 00:51:44,969
any damage or Sun which is required to
sometimes will go on cooldown for a

634
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:50,369
while red gloves kind the issue when
rolling ball to became your son instead

635
00:51:50,369 --> 00:51:55,349
of just the the kicked yeah then they
move in towards the midline volleyball

636
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:58,680
turns again own autopsy t-rex at me at
mine get him put down the eggs while the
top through the demonstrators be more

637
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:03,989
than up the children because Britney and
P tornado but in death you'll burn

638
00:52:03,989 --> 00:52:08,009
manner but that's it fly once again
being very liberal with that phrasing

639
00:52:08,009 --> 00:52:11,940
field they're immediately putting this
lens to use some males lens or well not

640
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,269
immediately but in that instance they
are putting it to use showcasing how
good this item can be against to hear

641
00:52:16,709 --> 00:52:20,670
like invoker their reach is just
exceptional Earth Spirit can roll in

642
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:24,059
from really far away and the Lima can
very easily follow up even though though

643
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:27,930
the earth spirits done is only level to
its it's enough force available asphalt
on is your combination sample get the

644
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:34,259
first on off and maybe the greatest of
chaining against it as for enchantress

645
00:52:34,259 --> 00:52:37,799
they're trying to find the damage the
Arctic earth put the tweaks on this

646
00:52:37,799 --> 00:52:41,989
happen some Al's already arrived from a
long way

647
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:47,299
but back from steps
I don't just hit him good question

648
00:52:47,299 --> 00:52:56,390
hey baby he's untouchable just hit him
so now is eg be aggressive Thompson with

649
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:58,910
a high ground
the MK tornado gonna make it difficult

650
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:03,140
for us easy besides not to dodge it but
he's got he's got what he wants our jizz

651
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:07,160
I love that you say decides not to dodge
it there's so many clips of our TZ man

652
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,430
to dodging whatever so yeah it's
assuming he will never fail he decides

653
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:15,799
not to there's no way he could have
failed that right hey I put out TZ up on

654
00:53:15,799 --> 00:53:20,270
a pedestal
for a click he is he is very rich by the

655
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:25,549
way 10k net worth 17 minutes in it's a
it's generally a very dangerous

656
00:53:25,549 --> 00:53:28,279
proposition to give terribly complete
free pop but I just think in this game

657
00:53:28,279 --> 00:53:32,000
hoji barely had a choice with their
draft it's just very defensive very slow

658
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,430
with both PA and freend and grim stroke
do they need to have someone to play

659
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:41,599
around and since the other two lanes
were Ichi favored the the tempo of the

660
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:44,690
game is just completely being dictated
by the CG side now what I do want to say

661
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:48,109
og shouldn't do stopped going for this
enchantress I think it's really hurting

662
00:53:48,109 --> 00:53:52,700
them the kills you have to accept ESPO
we farmed this game if you're not

663
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:56,660
bringing your PA to this kill it's too
far and the the cost benefit doesn't

664
00:53:56,660 --> 00:54:00,559
favor you kind of ever unless you see
pretty much the entire enemy lineup

665
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,960
somewhere else on the map cuz the
counter plays dangerous too right

666
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,039
imagine you kill the inch yeah just
everything yeah then what if there's an

667
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:10,520
earthquake coming in with this aleena
this is when you need stifling dagger
from range you need stuff to be the

668
00:54:11,869 --> 00:54:15,289
control you need to create a little bit
more space and I'm actually liking this

669
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:18,020
a little bit more content he's going in
for the academic center then he's gonna
build for the BKB so he can be that

670
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:25,670
nuisance that we know and love to be in
the faces of eg and give Ana that space

671
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:28,569
too far
he doesn't want to join it this is the

672
00:54:28,569 --> 00:54:35,470
way oh gee always play is poor attack
one farm now and so far he's now ahead

673
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:39,549
of both s4 as well as Sammael but he
still got a couple of thousand gold the

674
00:54:39,549 --> 00:54:41,619
cat dog which before he's gonna get in
front of RTZ

675
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:47,710
banana he's gonna move quick he's got a
farm quick now I don't think I think if

676
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:50,920
you're just mathematically but these two
heroes completely free punk from the

677
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,529
start of the game and they buy whatever
items they want terribly wins

678
00:54:53,529 --> 00:54:58,869
he just has better farming potential he
can farm wave wild farming jungle his

679
00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:02,349
first R and Grandpa items are just
faster the PA has to fill this whole

680
00:55:02,349 --> 00:55:06,069
battle fair before trouble as he can no
child walking in range of a sentry what

681
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:09,730
that dire century would get quickly d
warden have another one further up at

682
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:12,579
Anna and G racks on the bottom Lane
trying to push but smells already moving

683
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:16,930
down coming faster and shrine TP
supports on the way to the es starts top
tier racks going to land out a stone

684
00:55:18,249 --> 00:55:25,890
over on es but PA can't really do much
it's avail from downtown the Hobson

685
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:34,200
reply or is doubtful there is
it's the phantom assassin don't call it

686
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:39,720
out the same way at the short film
contest it's able to blink away two

687
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:46,290
teammates she's got those then straight
back to mid straight back to the thumb

688
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:49,700
the living outlet to protect building
into this desolator

689
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:59,670
why didn't the PETA just blink strike
the vet because 30 seconds why bounties

690
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:04,110
just not a better plan
30 seconds till bounty runes there's no

691
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:07,530
vessel charges so this fight for hoji if
they choose to run into the enemy team

692
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:10,110
will be hard being running into them
Thompson

693
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:13,890
yeah tornado is down so I get sent up
fritz going to work but eg they're
stopping for a shot that's what they

694
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:18,360
want Roberta the living I was giving him
some extra life damn big block in the

695
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,690
three-man push factor quick you'll set
the rope and through the rolling monitor

696
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:26,340
he misses but some male come on
Roshan he's still ticking down 3.5 K

697
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:31,260
energy are in no position to contest
this the low side they also have no idea

698
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:35,100
no tell was thinking about getting this
bouncy rune but it would have got him
killed

699
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:39,890
that's gonna be rosh as well as two
runes and what do they pay they don't

700
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:46,540
even pay at our bottom oh gee that's
tryin falling further and further behind

701
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:52,430
7500 and increasing is the net worth
advantage the experience of shooting up
as well and this is kind of it's a bit

702
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:58,490
reminiscent of one of toxins and vote
for games the TI 8 where I think it was

703
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:02,300
against LGD they sat on him really hard
and made him to slow down his tempo

704
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:06,260
because OGIS strategy when they play
this mated no fair was boss wax is is

705
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:10,670
very momentum based and you stifle that
momentum and so all of a sudden oh geez

706
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:13,850
line up just feels so much easier to do
in this game is the Earth Spirit Lina

707
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:17,600
getting these couple of kills on top so
now they just killed him again no vessel

708
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:22,880
charges and it just RTC's having the
time line this is such a free game right

709
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:31,550
now yeah a minute 20 it's easy looking
damn good I love how you bring up this a

710
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:35,030
male point cuz it was some male who used
to be the one like oh man this kids

711
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:37,880
really really good what do we do he's
playing stolen spirit with momentum base

712
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:42,140
let's just kill him every single time
there face of eg and now they're dishing
it out against theurgy and now Artesia

713
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:47,930
feels confidence are going into quest
towers he knows he has the aegis so even
if he gets echo slam there's that second

714
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:53,390
life and we hit the tower og seem like
they want to try to defend this one

715
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:57,560
though yes so is completed on Hanah this
is his first peak sad soon the full

716
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:06,530
wraparound he wants the greatest clip
were the coastal work they lose the tier

717
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:12,770
2 Tower in the meantime it gives away
information though yes eg OTE or eg no

718
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:16,190
ot are coming from behind top siddhis
looking for some bail he wants him in

719
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:19,980
the trees he's gonna move up and now huh
RUP tornado

720
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:24,180
the mail they want to send in dry your
stepped-up defensive nothing is put and

721
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:27,690
now they all turn around for the fight
has been before the salt mine as far as

722
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:31,230
walls are teaching together with a
double silence letting it go like doing

723
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:37,200
the work stand in this by the retina
Verity you want to get the hell out

724
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,920
there now they've killed crit that said
magnetized is on him

725
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:47,340
the fuel sector is up Sam is down
Thompson will be able to survive

726
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:50,550
he's waiting a little longer though
before he'll use his TV away and be able

727
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:53,100
to have that fight for me as crit he
rolls on the shaker
he keeps the shakers was invoked her

728
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:58,800
busy for a good I don't know 20 seconds
before he finally dies and it makes this

729
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:02,369
fight so easy for eg I wonder if we're
gonna get a replay of that think we saw

730
00:59:02,369 --> 00:59:06,940
the rolling Boulder but then the fight
was happening on the top side it's just

731
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:11,200
toxins toxins clearing the crate way he
understands they can't push up high
ground illusion is actually giving the

732
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:18,520
tower help with the fiddler the
regeneration up this all back to all

733
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,970
protection

734
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:27,240
but EEG lost nothing there didn't even
use meta they didn't have it so next

735
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,600
tower it's already being circled by fly
we're gonna see it now so Thompson catch

736
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,740
SML good defensive Jules but this role
the Earth Spirit is going to stay down

737
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,450
here forever
it might not be on the replay because

738
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:39,360
we've seen the fight up top but you
could imagine for yourself what's

739
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,970
happening off screen if you look at the
mini-map there's an earth spirit just
hit their course it echo keeping two

740
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:49,800
heroes at bay forever and honor Anna
just still feels like you can't really

741
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:53,790
fight comes in and just gets blown up by
spells it didn't even tell me Betty bee

742
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:57,420
didn't help they ended up jumping like
into the lagoon not like there's no BK

743
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:00,390
yeah Derby gave me to protect him and he
jumped right on top of the crystal main

744
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:04,410
to try and stop the breezing field to
the rest of the team improved fine but

745
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:07,410
will happen this hour debate as well as
I can the coastal maiden actually dive

746
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:11,820
you're we're asking this during during
the drafting phase like is this just

747
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:15,480
gonna be a massive massive problem with
your hands to me I top Safari

748
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:20,640
historically APA has just murdered many
and crystal made over the course of dota

749
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:25,200
games but nowadays maiden has health
talent she buys racers look at maidens

750
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,750
health right now
sure it's only five armor but she has

751
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:32,460
1430 help with just one bracer and a 1
in this talent can buy ghost scepter

752
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:36,000
maybe can buy another racer just tanked
oh and you will not be one shot jumping

753
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,210
by this PA you get a chance to hold your
ground and if you get your whole job

754
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:44,670
all this defensive armor is gonna you
know be super helpful dd expensive

755
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:48,030
bottled up ready for this right bar but
the living elbow I protect this much

756
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:50,240
longer

757
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:55,990
yeah it's gone man it's gone yo do you
want to defend a baby cause end up in
the end get rid of double damage for the

758
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:02,470
MP / Nazi easy again decides not to
dodge the EMP and seven he jumped in he

759
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:11,110
has the academic there take that melee
rax take the rage one as well what PA

760
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:19,330
comes return the bottom tower that's not
enough they need ball but Ichi first

761
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:25,270
wants to claim racks against og and they
do it in under 25 minutes this game has

762
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:28,870
been very one-sided so far I wonder if
before G can find a way back we've seen

763
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:32,260
them come back from ridiculous
situations many times before but it's

764
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:38,320
definitely it's a p8 crit that I never
want to say is not gonna work I what

765
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:41,680
happens once phantom assassin gets past
us what happens when you start keeping
her alacrity with a BKB I'm saluting her

766
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:49,120
into the fight Kenny G then like hold
through that blast

767
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:53,950
Tomsula keep doing this is an item that
will help the Enchantress picks up the

768
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:58,900
solar crust so whoever the PA jumps on
and small will defensively solar or of

769
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:03,070
course you can offensively solar as well
if they're going for kills but this item

770
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:06,460
is so good when you have terribly in
your team giving him that massive burst

771
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:13,820
of attack speed he's he's a monster
this game just flat-out insane farm

772
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:18,300
our G is still prepping for the fight
yeah it tells like it feels like they

773
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:21,450
need to wait for me to give honor and
then try to make a move with a smoke try
to find a way to get a fight inside

774
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:26,640
their own vision where they can get an
overgrowth you need to overgrowth this
terribly but yes both Manta and BKB so

775
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:35,550
he has two breaks now instead of only
the one of Manta it's a tall order only

776
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:38,130
the lowest impact we've seen from
no-till in any game at this tournament

777
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:43,320
it's just it's hardly options don't
exist he's gonna be a full-on cannon

778
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:47,610
with MK V you gotta see that notice bulb
actually arrived from TRX he does have

779
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:52,650
to eat the Lancer at least he'll have
that cost range Thompson 400 or ish gold

780
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:57,630
away from having his agonal set to build
up all of this is slowly going to arrive

781
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:01,980
it's gonna help it's definitely gonna
help to get this egg's he has some good

782
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:08,430
solutions for terribly illusions his
tornado the deafening blast EMP ice wall

783
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:12,840
that pinging outset it's like what is
this guy doing down here the creek waves

784
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:18,690
coming to at tier 3 town how crazy is
the es crazy enough to you happy to

785
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:21,180
bring some mail back but he can be T
back to the frontlines

786
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:25,990
yep well hopefully not the front lines
yeah I'm not really no obstacle

787
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:29,800
took the damage talent on Lena as well
on level 15 the light striker a damage

788
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,280
so it doesn't feel threatened enough to
take all the health it's uh pretty good

789
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,790
pickups to get health against to hear
like PA though you're naturally not too
high armor and I think earlier today we

790
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:43,180
saw moon when he was playing the Lena I
think he took the help health child and

791
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:52,450
that came against a yeah I believe maybe
I'll say yes different approaches to the

792
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:59,020
same problem AGGA names done
yeah the the problem for on a now is

793
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:03,099
you're like finally I have my BKB but
the counter items already ready is the

794
01:04:03,099 --> 01:04:07,270
agony mess on Lena and there's the
terrible aid mkb this upcoming fight a

795
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:12,640
subset service totally dead he's just
walking right into the middle of DJ's

796
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:16,089
room earth dump looking to attack then a
skirt is down he can't have enough life

797
01:04:16,089 --> 01:04:21,130
even with the jump up the hill he come
vacant so SEVIS down Anna was hiding

798
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:24,010
himself on the bottom Lane so it was
said who is walking away both were there

799
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:27,760
together for peace on from each it's one
person like Molina would come back to

800
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,480
try and fight cuz they have through
creepwave so pushing in they're gonna

801
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:36,520
fight with the alpha is eg actually have
enough start start you have protection

802
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:40,630
on multiple fronts clip as well as seven
shots to living OVA they'll burn throw

803
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:44,430
it and now you hold the power

804
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:49,000
the tower is gone
Fabio's like I can this kid can

805
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,710
occasionally keep up with the current
pace of this matter of dirt oh you see

806
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:58,600
that type of push yeah yeah he could do
it got the tower but he can't backdoor

807
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:02,369
the melee rax it's too much region too
tanky

808
01:05:02,369 --> 01:05:05,650
two three he's going to take the shine
he's gonna keep cutting the mid wave

809
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:08,890
good job from Thompson to make sure the
mid wave was pushed out he didn't manage

810
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:12,580
that they could have lost racks in this
instance as well gee it's desperation

811
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:15,070
time they need to fight through
metamorphosis mate running out and

812
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:18,970
importantly the observer in century
comes right up towards RTZ Thompson
finds its own target

813
01:05:38,329 --> 01:05:41,109
please

814
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:46,810
the question back the book is all flying
back right now birth control in life

815
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:50,170
these never-ending stuff come from the
lane of the egg consent hitter right

816
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:55,000
finally in from death but one face be
created and realize he'd be Oliver eg

817
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,230
and jump away for the symmetric
traceless skillful turn has that run for

818
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:05,560
the trees that he bought be saved onto
the arms instead returned earrings is no

819
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:10,900
way to run away terribly will create the
mirror st. just out of the range of the

820
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:15,730
stun their town was to help out on TV
just diving in Hannah and Leah get a

821
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:19,240
crimper that's easy remember what he
came to here for a while ago it was to
tape the lane of racks and they've got

822
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:26,530
the damage output that built the green
wave energy have no defense maybe they

823
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:30,880
could kill mopes a male it becomes a
pike rampant the rest of eg are moving

824
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,890
towards the min they want to fight Anna
he blinks outfits avail
he flakes away

825
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:46,750
community that they wanna get deeper
into RG you may about Bob do be the you

826
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:51,010
burn fountain bomb this time around
their G eg

827
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:53,859
on the team for towels maybe there's a
little bit too deep it's only two
players up trying to fend this here

828
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:59,200
comes your meatball down but in burka
he's got nothing more to get dirt out

829
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:06,490
into the face they're all damaged eg eg
take Game one here but account on the

830
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:09,089
main stage

831
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:17,440
they're not destroyed only that's fair
to say but that was a

832
01:07:18,289 --> 01:07:22,730
in eg
back back here some male got a Kenny's

833
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:28,730
man he crashed that mid lane so hot but
these long range stuff but he he called

834
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:33,230
out the ether lens but it felt like some
male was just despondent lock down but

835
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:43,190
never in any trouble from og it was not
really right yeah it the earthgrid

836
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:45,920
factor what are you gonna pick against
Lina right spirit that you feel like

837
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:50,270
just can't die it may be rude but I
think it might have been banned Bruce

838
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:52,730
could have actually been a really good
picnicking but I don't think just tops

839
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:58,609
anything to play that hero I'm not sure
but yeah that what can I say eg I think

840
01:07:58,609 --> 01:08:01,400
the biggest key to the game here and
then was that they placed the lanes

841
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,730
correctly that was what gave him the
start and she gets shaker they get the

842
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:08,390
aggro trialing that OG weren't expecting
and the mid lane they destroyed it so

843
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:11,470
excellent job from them

844
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:24,149
[Music]

845
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:28,049
midlane yeah you gotta have a better
performance than that cuz sumail as they

846
01:08:28,049 --> 01:08:32,219
said he just completely dominated it
obviously crit you know came over and

847
01:08:32,219 --> 01:08:35,730
helped him even fly came through and
helped they really did not want Thompson
navigate yeah but you know you didn't

848
01:08:37,139 --> 01:08:41,940
talk about who's that didn't talk about
asked for I want to talk about s4 I want
to talk about enchantress what is this

849
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:47,549
hero was she capable of allow me to
demonstrate

850
01:08:47,549 --> 01:08:54,929
if will I may show you to the powers of
Technology we have a hero with a passive

851
01:08:54,929 --> 01:08:57,420
called untouchable now if you're
unfamiliar with enchantress as a hero

852
01:08:57,420 --> 01:09:02,400
yeah you see 1340 HP you think okay you
know she's blocked out four heroes

853
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:05,488
obviously should be dying okay maybe a
lucky stun all right maybe maybe maybe

854
01:09:05,488 --> 01:09:08,939
she's doing a little bit too much damage
screw it sub says I don't even want to

855
01:09:08,939 --> 01:09:13,198
deal with this hero s4 is just chucking
out these impetuses without a care in

856
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:17,369
the world it's six minutes into the game
something like that sixteen minutes in

857
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:19,109
the game we slowly progressed a little
bit forward

858
01:09:19,109 --> 01:09:28,770
I swear hasn't - life's good oh no it's
three heroes no you couldn't finish her

859
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:32,400
off things are starting to get a little
bit bad now because the rest of ichi has
shown up all of a sudden s4 lives not a

860
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:39,120
care in the world and one more time in
case I haven't made my point how do you

861
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,790
even need to know what's going on blitz
what's going on is enchantress she died

862
01:09:41,790 --> 01:09:46,710
no she's not she's got full HP wait but
she got soul bounds of like a terrible

863
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:53,940
end right yeah no she's fine she's gone
up she's laughing unbelievable as for

864
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:57,959
obviously magnificent performance on the
hero but you gotta you gotta give props

865
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:02,100
to that eg draught I'm sure there's
gonna be some people at home that are

866
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:09,630
not too familiar with enchantress I'm
like did my computer just know you're

867
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:14,010
not buffering you're operating at full
speed and so is eg yeah what a crazy

868
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:18,780
game well what do you make of that oh
that game was I that was a stump I was
like a stomp and a half - it was just uh

869
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:24,780
every opportunity they had to go on
Hopsin they absolutely ruined him I
think even got solo killed once right

870
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:31,469
yeah I mean oh that's really what
started that ball and I mean they never

871
01:10:31,469 --> 01:10:33,870
let go
sumail just kind of made his mark on

872
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:36,989
this game
they poke the Beast nope they did now I

873
01:10:36,989 --> 01:10:40,320
was thinking you look back to that the
the second clip you showed that was

874
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,039
Winsett pretty much showed his blink he
got those two kills if he somehow got

875
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:47,849
Enchantress in that because they were
all three clumped up but he was like two

876
01:10:47,849 --> 01:10:50,969
seconds too late honestly it could have
changed a lot of things but the fact

877
01:10:50,969 --> 01:10:55,349
enchantress ran away and you're not
killing her it really you just could not

878
01:10:55,349 --> 01:11:00,690
kill her that game now this game was
decided pretty fast and I think we'll it
was you that said before this before the

879
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:08,010
series that Thompson he loses you the
lane but when she well how did you say

880
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:11,369
you said it way nicer no I said he's
probably here he's probably the player
that loses you he loses his Lane the

881
01:11:14,099 --> 01:11:18,239
most but he's also the player that'll
win you the game vhost yes unfortunately
this time he I mean we're talking about

882
01:11:21,929 --> 01:11:25,619
right 9 0 and 10 on arteezy it's a
terrible a right he is just for me he's

883
01:11:25,619 --> 01:11:28,829
doing his thing but he knew when to go
and he knew when not to they they

884
01:11:28,829 --> 01:11:32,999
backdoor through a tier 3 even when Anna
was cutting creeps he just made all the

885
01:11:32,999 --> 01:11:36,630
right plays and I mean RTZ
I mean everyone wants to win a TI but

886
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:39,929
this guy right has been favored to win
so many T eyes you know it's in the back

887
01:11:39,929 --> 01:11:43,860
of his head even Oh the hunger is
showing for sure and I love that they

888
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:47,130
ran up the aggressive try them as well
you know it's it's a little bit of the

889
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:50,610
mind game so you want to go head to head
you don't want to avoid fights sometimes

890
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:55,440
that is what you try to do but this game
they they wanted to take it they fought

891
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:59,610
hard and they made sure that they that
they got him the action early on which

892
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:04,260
was a little difficult for og2 to answer
tsunami this is a taste of oh geez own

893
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:07,199
medicine this is what they like to do
unless if it's a quarrel then oftentimes
it will look like oh geez losing it

894
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:12,780
first no like ah you know obviously the
score I was not gonna work out and then

895
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:15,840
dude gets Dagenham scepter Dominator and
then all of a sudden you're like oh yeah

896
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,110
that's how it works
but this time it was just pedal to the
metal from minute zero yeah and it was a

897
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:26,579
the tree and I'm really surprised they
put it on five I wasn't the biggest fan

898
01:12:26,579 --> 01:12:29,579
of that I was talking with fogged as
well and we're just wondering like what

899
01:12:29,579 --> 01:12:32,639
does he do it didn't feel like you know
they always want to defend their towers

900
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:39,900
do their thing and they really could not
defend their towers at all laughing a
grant mistakes that's the best way of

901
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:47,739
doing it now that's what oh geez doing
is as well and actually we know that the

902
01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:52,059
what they're doing most of them yeah
most you think even even against them we

903
01:12:52,059 --> 01:12:55,929
have a professional eSports
psychologists that's true but what if

904
01:12:55,929 --> 01:12:59,610
the psychologist saw this is like oh my

905
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:09,190
you already said that maybe maybe she
ran away because of that baby yeah it
was just I mean it's tough it really is

906
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:14,710
hard to talk about that game cuz it was
just that one side crit played perfectly

907
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:17,949
middle sumail as well they just didn't
kill arty if you don't kill terrorblade

908
01:13:17,949 --> 01:13:19,840
you're gonna lose a game it's as simple
as that

909
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:28,389
yeah all right you know what I hope that
og is taking a break taking a moment you

910
01:13:28,389 --> 01:13:33,909
know getting and getting some time to to
reset they are needing it and I know a
lot of you at home needed to we have the

911
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:43,300
perfect recipe for a reset okay see it's
like hey you're not shoving me over and

912
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:47,499
reaction to the vote like you did
earlier I mean I'll take any excuse I

913
01:13:47,499 --> 01:13:50,980
can to shove you but I got too much
excitement for the games on that last

914
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:56,260
series man eg everybody knows this team
right well they think they know them

915
01:13:56,260 --> 01:14:00,969
actually you might not know the greatest
North American squad ever and that's why

916
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:06,599
they got a little peek in their back
stories take a look at this piece

917
01:14:07,499 --> 01:14:13,690
these first teams always have drama
sometimes it's real but a lot of it is

918
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:15,350
just the community making something out
of nothing

919
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:19,489
[Music]
for example there's a lot of talk this
year about evil geniuses not being a

920
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:26,599
real North American team let me tell you
something boys that couldn't be further

921
01:14:26,599 --> 01:14:29,019
from the truth

922
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:41,789
orders party Oh who's our Renaissance at
32

923
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:58,290
I mean sure we're both North American
but the other guys are way more North

924
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:05,910
American than us especially a crate and
you're back at your finals I guess what

925
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:14,040
it's okay I guess I sorta took a short
joke hey sorry about that your whore sir

926
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:17,970
hope you're funny in the grand finals
eight shoot you

927
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:24,660
shady in a way I think the boys are
actually model North Americans they even

928
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:31,520
have that classic any assault all right
listen up I'm so mad right now good

929
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:35,550
stuff with your troll warlord to mail I
don't want to see no fucking underlord

930
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:39,660
middle gustav if you ask for puck one
more time I swear to you God it's not

931
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:47,010
ti3 anymore hey I told you know what
fucking camera in the end you're just

932
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:50,480
some North American boy is trying to
make our way into this here intervention
together United

933
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:59,660
one team under dota North America

934
01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:07,980
Wow man what a great North American
squad representing America I'm here in
Shanghai did you know that kind of any

935
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:14,070
spirit they had I had no idea that was
quite the informative documentary you

936
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:20,100
put together yes indeed it was but we
have more actions to see today we got an

937
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:25,200
even better show because sheaves and the
boys we got more dough to be seen we do
indeed and I cannot wait to see all the

938
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:32,820
different scenarios used in all
different kinds of clips and memes
because there's so much potential thank

939
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:42,570
you for that thank you guys
yeah I can't believe what we just

940
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:46,320
watched but I mean you already knew that
they were North Americans to the core

941
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:50,280
yeah I did you know everyone on reddit's
gonna always argue with me but you know

942
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:54,630
being the ambassador of na I'd like to
think I knew these guys were all an a

943
01:16:54,630 --> 01:17:01,340
from the star in yeah I mean crit
Canadian I knew that as well I guess

944
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:30,870
well yeah you gotta test bullets out
first logically it all it all added up
yeah it's a bullet thing there was some

945
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:38,490
continuity errors there before me yeah
oh yeah quietly there we'll what are you

946
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:45,120
thinking oh no I just I was reading like
they're acting and is the best the best

947
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:51,450
is probably correct wait they were
acting I think flying was the best

948
01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:54,240
really
yeah who's Captain America speciall oh

949
01:17:54,240 --> 01:18:06,270
the worst by far was Sam's oh I think he
said orders Oh Carrie burgers not Oh

950
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:09,180
d'oeuvres
yeah but Oh d'oeuvres are

951
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:17,760
Oh d'oeuvres are far filthier aren't
they wait is that it real oh yeah and so

952
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:22,020
obviously we Americans have burgers as
an appetizer and burgers is a meal and

953
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:28,260
burgers for dessert thank you true
perfect all right let's talk about these

954
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:33,390
two teams because they're about to be
well at the moment Yugi is about to be

955
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:39,330
in the top three of Ti we saw them in
the top three last year top three is not

956
01:18:39,330 --> 01:18:42,560
enough the performance that they showed
here in this first game though

957
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:47,670
definitely worthy of more than top three
that looked so dominant yeah yeah yeah

958
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:50,490
it really did and I think the biggest
thing it is it's gonna come down to that

959
01:18:50,490 --> 01:18:54,030
draft cuz it felt like they got out
drafted from the beginning we I said

960
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:56,850
some teams gonna pay your sphere I
actually didn't expect it to be first

961
01:18:56,850 --> 01:18:58,950
pick
he just roamed on middle he roamed
bottom he was actually in all three

962
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:04,800
lanes like he he played perfectly so
shout out to boba you know we all like

963
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:09,390
to clown on him but he did his job that
game and he's he's coached a team to ti

964
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:14,070
championship before which also was eg by
the way and he might just do it again in
tsunami yeah and the most important

965
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:19,620
thing is getting this game one victory
because og have not been tested that
much during this tea right now during

966
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,510
the group stage didn't drop very many
games as they moved their way through

967
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:27,600
the upper bracket they have not dropped
that many games being able to finally

968
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,470
show that they bleed and show some
vulnerability is a huge step for

969
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:34,350
confidence for you yeah and I think I
mean you look at the group stage I

970
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:37,620
believe they had two or three laws so I
I don't remember but only one of them
was truly serious to me was the vici

971
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:42,360
gaming loss and I definitely know one
was a Kentucky's loss or something

972
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:46,050
exactly and I think you have a lot of
luggage like okay this is the one loss

973
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:50,400
they truly had and I'm sure they scoured
all the replays and well it works
welcome back on og reset oh yeah for

974
01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:57,930
sure they can and they want a TI you
know they're mentally tough team I feel

975
01:19:57,930 --> 01:20:01,380
like if any teams gonna do it and
they're able to like walk it off and

976
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:05,100
have fun it's gonna be oh gee you saw no
tell like spamming voice lines till the

977
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:10,680
very end spamming his face literally I
think they're beaming it up too with

978
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:14,160
like the the faces all right it's like
the first step by the way towards the

979
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:20,160
reconciliation well let's see how well
they mean in the upcoming game because

980
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:24,200
the teams are taking the stage once
again

981
01:20:25,159 --> 01:20:33,929
there you go our shoulder to shoulder
they do look like they are reset and

982
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:38,400
ready to go
shake it up no then you up tailor surf

983
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,630
don't you blitz I do I do

984
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:48,300
Yugi is also relaxed as they are one
game up that definitely takes some

985
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:57,230
pressure off you know what also takes
pressure off a nice relaxing massage

986
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:08,470
[Music]

987
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:15,189
hi how are you
[Music]

988
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:20,150
Thompson

989
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:26,520
[Music]
oh hey wake up

990
01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:36,870
wake up ya know
are we done here I know I always ask

991
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:41,460
this of players but I am fascinated by
whether or not you guys feel stressed

992
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:43,980
cuz you do this is what you do all the
time
yeah a dick massages other things yes

993
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:53,310
the dodo claim I'm saying dota isn't
that stressful that traveling I I hate

994
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:57,120
it why do you hate traveling I don't
know I just stressed about stupid things
like what losing my phone oh oh

995
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:10,469
interviews what can I do in interviews
to make you feel less nervous I don't

996
01:22:10,469 --> 01:22:14,219
know there's just sit home playing dog
on this aren't there in front of a

997
01:22:14,219 --> 01:22:20,730
camera it's like what fuck is this but
you're on camera while you play yeah but
there what's in the game they're

998
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:26,219
watching us play they're not watching us
watching us yeah what's the question you

999
01:22:26,219 --> 01:22:35,219
hate getting asked the most
I don't tell who is the most likely

1000
01:22:35,219 --> 01:22:41,219
person on your team to make a mistake
that's not fair no that's really shit

1001
01:22:41,219 --> 01:22:49,790
Crescent I found it it was easy
[Laughter]

1002
01:22:49,790 --> 01:22:57,699
[Music]
how crucial is crucial is Anna to your

1003
01:22:57,699 --> 01:23:01,750
roster cuz I know that you had to play
without him for quite some time yeah it

1004
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:08,620
is it's like a favorite my favorite fare
like I'm a big fan of fish and I know

1005
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:13,719
understands me and I understand Anna and
it wasn't the case with other players so

1006
01:23:13,719 --> 01:23:19,390
for me it was it's really really nice to
play Donna do you feel any extra

1007
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:29,350
pressure coming back is txc I know what
you're trying to say ah no not really I

1008
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:36,000
mean we have had pretty average year it
just barely made it to TI right and

1009
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:41,940
we're so happy that we made it to TI and
we'll see how we feel then but right now

1010
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:48,670
they're feeling wishing good I think
what are you gonna do after your dota

1011
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:55,719
career ends someday oh man I'm gonna buy
a house and Arden sealants so you're

1012
01:23:55,719 --> 01:24:01,360
just gonna live a quiet life yeah that's
the dream fast forward 20 years ring

1013
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:17,230
ring ring yeah you pick up the phone and
it's me oh shit Hopson thanks for doing

1014
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:25,030
this mm-hm I feel like I'm raising my
hand to ask a question you who Dobson

1015
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:29,830
over here yeah I was just wondering how
you're planning on beating all the other

1016
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:36,040
teams at TI and I know you destroy the
throne and then they lose easy

1017
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:39,090
[Music]

1018
01:24:39,159 --> 01:24:45,130
you destroyed a throne and then they
lose or than you win that is the goal it

1019
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:49,840
seems pretty simple can they do that
here in Game two

1020
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:53,679
cuz if they don't they're gonna go to
the lower bracket haven't experienced

1021
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:58,960
that yet in a while let's find out what
is going to happen in Game two of eg og

1022
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,400
it is time for the draft

1023
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:17,369
[Music]
[Applause]

1024
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:31,099
[Music]
love the way they set up their lanes and

1025
01:25:31,099 --> 01:25:34,340
they played super aggressive throughout
the game I think that's definitely a key

1026
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:37,099
factor for them going into this next one
versus og because that just looked it

1027
01:25:37,099 --> 01:25:39,920
looks super good right they just took
over the whole game is they kept making

1028
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:44,179
those aggressive plays or picks from
berlin-- heroes I I was a real question

1029
01:25:44,179 --> 01:25:48,729
mark in the last pic in Booker against
Toledo yeah and there's our spare room

1030
01:25:48,729 --> 01:25:52,820
and those Islands
they weren't that great to the pa is
pretty weak 3/5 is pretty weak yeah

1031
01:25:57,010 --> 01:26:01,070
looks like we have same bands so far so
this is always fun to see are they gonna
do something different are they gonna

1032
01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:05,719
stick with the same heroes one thing I
feel like I see if in terms just does

1033
01:26:05,719 --> 01:26:08,510
make it through is they pick heroes that
actually can kill her yeah they take

1034
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:12,440
magic Nucor is that kind of a thing but
OG did themselves no favours at all a
tsunami showed the last segment they

1035
01:26:14,179 --> 01:26:18,079
didn't have ways to kill her and as a
result every other early movements just

1036
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:21,229
we're completely counteracted and it
made the stomp so much harder yeah I

1037
01:26:21,229 --> 01:26:23,300
definitely booth Febby just pick some
stronger lanes

1038
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:26,479
I think shadow demon was ignored right
that was one here that made it through

1039
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:30,019
the entire trap stuff and because they
opened up with the grim stroke so EG

1040
01:26:30,019 --> 01:26:32,599
didn't feel like they had to go for it
they wanted the crystal Maiden so yeah

1041
01:26:32,599 --> 01:26:37,130
Steve one of the few series that we
actually see it just wasn't touched now

1042
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:43,130
it was a bad last game I don't believe
it was I think the event Ichi yeah so

1043
01:26:43,130 --> 01:26:46,849
they're like they're like having some
they're baiting by enchantra's pick I

1044
01:26:46,849 --> 01:26:50,179
think now they're also making sure that
they can get themselves et - right

1045
01:26:50,179 --> 01:26:52,639
they're like eg you have to ban or
otherwise we get alchemists yeah all

1046
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:55,909
right they're switching the formula up a
little bit so they're forced to bend
that out cuz of it so now you can get

1047
01:26:58,219 --> 01:27:01,729
that answer itself yeah I mean it's
definitely more of a comfort pick for

1048
01:27:01,729 --> 01:27:05,090
them it's something they've been picking
consistently for seven the offlane and

1049
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:08,900
it's putting the strong arrow in their
hands yeah and like I said in the first
game booter seems like the only five

1050
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:15,530
that's really comfortable on the
Enchantress it's right here already

1051
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:19,369
you're talking about ways to kill and
chant wrist right elder titan put decent

1052
01:27:19,369 --> 01:27:22,909
amount of magic damage also a big
amplification Mirana high magic damage

1053
01:27:22,909 --> 01:27:26,630
if you are able to get on top and good
combos and another thing that Marana has

1054
01:27:26,630 --> 01:27:30,079
been really effective at so far this
tournament is just like stomping games

1055
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:35,030
with really effective rotations and good
disable setups basically one disable

1056
01:27:35,030 --> 01:27:39,350
into a three to five second stun that's
almost always going to be a killed hero

1057
01:27:39,350 --> 01:27:42,650
if as long as they can line fill out the
rest of their lineup with a lot of other
stunt setups eg might be able to just

1058
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:49,700
stop the lanes kind of similar to last
game just gonna go for their Earthshaker
here the way to disrupt like those type

1059
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:55,070
of combo plays so surprise you shadow
team is just not gonna be touched not

1060
01:27:55,070 --> 01:27:58,640
even going for the save but you do see a
lot of times versus like being are the

1061
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:02,990
under on it yeah it's very rare actually
that I feel like moronic it's picked
well I see still the pool because it is

1062
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:09,200
too figured counter there but they let
it through it is a really good hero with

1063
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:14,180
a Enchantress a colorful enchantress
sweeping whoa oh this is which is the

1064
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:18,350
lack of teamfight sure crystals have a
lot of damage but it lacks lockdown and

1065
01:28:18,350 --> 01:28:25,820
the peak a Wii controller which
Earthshaker provides also potentially
interrupt the elder Titan combos

1066
01:28:27,490 --> 01:28:31,220
possibly stunning Ron at the right time
could help a lot drop a fissure when she

1067
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:34,850
needs to throw her arrow for example
those kinds of things could be a

1068
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:39,470
solution as well it's really less likely
but I think it's pretty cool to see

1069
01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:44,030
songs Mariana - because I know he's
loved east on their hero yeah both
straps are kind of flexible right now at

1070
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:48,560
this point like you said oh gee they
could be playing The Enchantress they

1071
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,800
could move it around if they want to
choose to do so DT is probably locked as

1072
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:55,220
like a five position I would probably
have seen crit also played so for five

1073
01:28:55,220 --> 01:29:00,650
smarana also kind of flexible so it's
probably oh five ET no yeah for them so
I would imagine right that's what

1074
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:05,420
they're thinking as well - by bending
out that stanking

1075
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:11,330
I think you got that easy setup also
that high magic damage here oh yeah

1076
01:29:11,330 --> 01:29:15,080
that's true and with Vale as well if you
pair ET with a common veil builder the

1077
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:18,290
amount of magic damage you're doing this
massive a lot more than even normal so

1078
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:23,930
which is enchantress is weakly weakness
enchanters is really affair - magical

1079
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:27,500
damage and it takes out a team fight or
two right like the syncing provides

1080
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:31,960
quite a bit so that's why they're
looking to ban that one out

1081
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:37,280
every spirit getting banned by evil
geniuses a very good hero for jumping

1082
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,550
around the teamfight
Oh also pretty possible to avoid things

1083
01:29:40,550 --> 01:29:43,429
like arrow set up sometimes because if
you have even a tiny fraction of a

1084
01:29:43,429 --> 01:29:46,820
second where you aren't stun you can
dodge arrows and dodge other abilities

1085
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:50,389
so will be a little bit of a headache
for all the time defending it so getting

1086
01:29:50,389 --> 01:29:53,780
on top of these heroes can be pretty
easy as an ember spare to like elder

1087
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:56,690
titan play a lot of the hero you you
just get jumped on instantly you get

1088
01:29:56,690 --> 01:29:59,719
rooted in the middle of your stomp
animation it messes with you more on the

1089
01:29:59,719 --> 01:30:02,360
same thing you get rooted you can't leap
the whole time it's a long duration

1090
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:05,540
lockdown frustrating here to play
against for sure if you do have an ETA

1091
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:07,840
Barona

1092
01:30:09,190 --> 01:30:13,250
conquer the next band very comments that
appear with Muranos always a lot of

1093
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:17,210
teams successfully use that combo just
because it gives you the easiest settup

1094
01:30:17,210 --> 01:30:23,150
ever I wonder what kind of damage hero
each is gonna pick I think I assume like

1095
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:28,849
s4 is going to play some AoE
magic for damage control hero which can

1096
01:30:28,849 --> 01:30:34,989
kill the Enchantress what do you think
in like a tiny or something

1097
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:40,990
too early to tell
yeah I think it's sorted I feel like

1098
01:30:40,990 --> 01:30:44,380
kind of a bit too single target as well
what about tidehunter tidehunter was

1099
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:47,920
like first phase man and the beachy LGD
series earlier today but we haven't seen

1100
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:51,370
either of these guys touching it I think
something like that would be useful here

1101
01:30:51,370 --> 01:30:55,240
kite is pretty cool you can like stop
though or shaker from getting his combos

1102
01:30:55,240 --> 01:31:00,310
off with the ravage but I assume like if
they do pick tide they need more damage

1103
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:08,020
I don't think it's not it's enough
damage what about like a typical like

1104
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:12,490
mid laner turned off laner like a leash
or a pug no lush band of course no
national something like that would work

1105
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:17,680
and putting his plant it was a very
common opening for a lot of teams

1106
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:23,830
actually go like et less just because
you amplify your damage so much but I

1107
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:30,340
think they what about their like the
gyrocopter for eg for that first I don't

1108
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:33,310
know I don't like the Tyrell versus
enchanters not sure but I think it can

1109
01:31:33,310 --> 01:31:36,550
go both ways
yeah gyro can get on top of injectors

1110
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:42,220
sure but enchantra's like by nature can
is a good hurricane pipe fire they can

1111
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:45,820
like shoot impetuses from very far it
can out range those gyros so sometimes
it can go the other way around

1112
01:31:47,230 --> 01:31:50,710
yeah I've seen kind of evokes ik teams
have a think the exact same way right

1113
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:53,560
we've seen some teams like they pick the
gyro in th enter another seems they pick

1114
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:56,620
the Enchantress first at the gyro just
huh yeah it's fun fun to see those type
of back and forth three teams be an ogre

1115
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:05,830
yeah very high health very high armor
tanky hero can be a three down over high

1116
01:32:05,830 --> 01:32:08,740
magic damage you know it's all
especially with DT Zora

1117
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:12,430
so the downside that the the part that
it doesn't fit of what you wanted Febby

1118
01:32:12,430 --> 01:32:15,370
is no not that much AE we damage
basically so you can't push out lanes

1119
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:20,320
barrel but you can't just stay in your
lane living it not be harassed out of it

1120
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:23,590
and continue to pressure that way that's
one option for the hero and then later

1121
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:27,730
on during the teamfights it's a natural
pipettor go to so our shaker is not
gonna have as much impact

1122
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:36,890
how do you feel about that Peck I was
thinking void for eg about a bit good

1123
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:42,200
for the AoE control and especially with
the et but yeah Mooji picks void
it's okay because enchantress provides

1124
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:48,410
damage every time you have what we can
want damage in your Chrome and I think

1125
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:51,350
enchantress is the damage I took it
might've been a bit of a steal pick

1126
01:32:51,350 --> 01:32:54,440
right maybe if Yugi was gonna look for
it because it's I mean with the et
Moroni it's amazing so that does kind of

1127
01:32:56,990 --> 01:32:59,660
look like they just kind of robbed that
one a YF eg was looking to go for that

1128
01:32:59,660 --> 01:33:02,870
type of hero yeah cuz that's definitely
one of the issues with the Branagh pick

1129
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:06,440
right now is that there just aren't a
ton of aricept obviously stomp is

1130
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:09,890
amazing but in the laning stage it's
gonna be a little bit harder avoid also

1131
01:33:09,890 --> 01:33:12,530
even good against that if they're
lacking disables ogres gotta get close
range to land his stun et's got to land

1132
01:33:14,450 --> 01:33:18,500
this obvious stomp that that boy can
easily time walk so right now Muranos

1133
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:22,280
not looking like the best for actually
and they might it I mean he still could

1134
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:24,620
move it right now they have bloodlust as
well they they're keeping themselves

1135
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:29,980
open to switching it up still on the
side of Ichi that's true

1136
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:33,380
like Feb you're saying right like sumail
he loves playing his Marana sometimes

1137
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:35,750
and we've seen it we have seen a couple
Kormoran as we have seen a couple of

1138
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:38,900
them in the mid lane from I think I
think I know BG played it a couple of

1139
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:43,250
times too they're gonna take the gyro no
it's something that they need so may we

1140
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:49,400
saw masks were damaged gyro feels a
little bit iffy against chronosphere +

1141
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:53,240
enchantress to me though cuz I mean he
traditionally does get a lot of health

1142
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:55,670
and yes maybe he'll buy a butterfly at
some point but getting

1143
01:33:55,670 --> 01:33:58,730
chronosphere and not having too many
saves on the backline
might be really scary for he's my

1144
01:34:00,650 --> 01:34:03,260
favorite pairing though with other
tightening favorite carry pairing

1145
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:06,380
because your mix you're not just
physical damage you're very high magical

1146
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:09,140
damage so you work really well and it
provides you extra teamfight which I

1147
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:12,170
think that they you know the ogre might
have made them lack a little bit there

1148
01:34:12,170 --> 01:34:15,680
yeah it's a couple that eg is very
familiar with we've been seeing it a

1149
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:20,450
couple of times in the crew stages to
which ret tiny that looks like it's a
very high potential for Thompson's hero

1150
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:26,570
he's been super dominant action hero
when I saw him playing it for the most

1151
01:34:26,570 --> 01:34:30,580
part just being able to constantly run
around and just wreak havoc on the map

1152
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:34,310
especially versity squishies gyrocopter
can tend to be a little bit squishy

1153
01:34:34,310 --> 01:34:39,740
sometimes no tickets are with the expert
- I think it like just inputs insane a
while of damage and I think it's all it

1154
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:46,050
can be a cool you call
the void plus tiny with tiny eggs that's

1155
01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:50,280
true I like that no it's really good
with Lloyd it helps so much I think

1156
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:53,370
mineski was running that earlier hey
what the corona would come out and then

1157
01:34:53,370 --> 01:34:57,690
you do the tiny tree toss you get in
like six seven eight trees really good

1158
01:34:57,690 --> 01:35:01,080
cobble was that the same thing that I
did secret have a tune with the void and

1159
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:04,200
the tiny I think mid one brush - yeah I
know the apps are still chronosphere a

1160
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:07,110
few times
probably yeah there's a lot of a lot of

1161
01:35:07,110 --> 01:35:09,360
lot of Chronos through those games
oh yeah you're right actually that's a

1162
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:12,600
good point cuz I remember him he skipped
the echo saver hey why not go save her

1163
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:15,180
after we went straight eggs which was
interesting to me because usually it's

1164
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:17,730
like you want your echo cuz you apply
the slope but if you have something like
that huge lockdown you don't need the

1165
01:35:19,410 --> 01:35:25,050
extra slow you're gonna be having that
big damage pump into its own that's I'm

1166
01:35:25,050 --> 01:35:28,410
expecting to eg to throw a dryer in the
midlane myself just because two males

1167
01:35:28,410 --> 01:35:32,580
typically the guy that plays it on their
team I mean if you do land an arrow mate

1168
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:35,580
even if there isn't a setup it sometimes
there can't be with homing missile it's

1169
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:38,430
a good hero for crossing the river and
eventually getting solo kills at the

1170
01:35:38,430 --> 01:35:41,550
stuns long I don't know if it's gonna be
super viable against tiny because Tiny's

1171
01:35:41,550 --> 01:35:45,960
health is pretty high but we won't get
many last hits in that lane though if

1172
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:50,130
you're mid versa tiny that's true you
can use the missile to stone him every

1173
01:35:50,130 --> 01:35:55,260
now and then but the base damage
advantage is really high but so flexible

1174
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:59,850
right they still can choose to move it
around depend on which matchup they do

1175
01:35:59,850 --> 01:36:04,890
want to have we have one bright side is
they can probably route control maybe a

1176
01:36:04,890 --> 01:36:09,950
little bit better with the mana and the
drivers a lot faster so running him down
may be lower chance of Jardine

1177
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:19,920
last fancier batrider again being banned
towards OG they are kind of lacking

1178
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:25,170
their five position hero and then OD
being banned on against Evie who should

1179
01:36:25,170 --> 01:36:27,870
have been another great hero for setting
up airs that they throw OD in the mid

1180
01:36:27,870 --> 01:36:31,830
lane especially against a melee like
tiny super easy to banish and get

1181
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:35,190
guaranteed arrows so it would have been
a pretty easy way for topspin losses

1182
01:36:35,190 --> 01:36:39,390
lane a lot of the Kankuro d bands when
there's a Priam early Marana picks it's

1183
01:36:39,390 --> 01:36:43,620
like you kind of just have to cover your
bases yeah so what are they gonna grab

1184
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:48,870
for the last hero G could play the tiny
as a four that could put the Enchantress

1185
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:52,530
on a five that could leave tops enough
to grabbing an entirely new hero here if

1186
01:36:52,530 --> 01:36:55,980
they really want to but there's only
cool things that we can do right now

1187
01:36:55,980 --> 01:37:00,690
they can put five in chantry's mid tiny
and like pick on you or hero for

1188
01:37:00,690 --> 01:37:04,500
Darren's Phoenix 2spooky even if there's
a me ran out the other team you have

1189
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:14,100
void it feels I think it sounds okay but
I just feel like they're lacking easy

1190
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:18,090
disables and gank stuff that isn't
teamfight like ultimate base it's like

1191
01:37:18,090 --> 01:37:20,760
chronosphere maybe like blink
Earthshaker

1192
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:29,040
or blink tiny but I feel like they need
something reliable maybe okay I think

1193
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:32,580
it's a it's a good feed seeded game
there's a lot of magical damage coming

1194
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:36,810
out of you geniuses right now right now
order damage is matched for damage and

1195
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:41,489
now our second spare is just gonna be
gate a lot of that damage and they use
Oracle's ultimate to just purge off a

1196
01:37:43,710 --> 01:37:48,330
stunt if they if somebody like if the
faceless void gets stunned at a crucial

1197
01:37:48,330 --> 01:37:52,310
moment tiny gets not a crucial moment to
remove that let him take a teamfight

1198
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:55,980
it's pretty cool
I was thinking void might beetle stud I
might need a save because there's a lot

1199
01:37:57,719 --> 01:38:02,489
of lockdown from Evil Geniuses and there
was no save on from og on to the Oracle
tech so they could have

1200
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:08,400
bursted a void down before the teamfight
started is it gonna be strong enough to

1201
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:12,120
lane against an ogre though like the
other here if that's an offline ogre

1202
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:15,239
you have to slap that guy a lot to get
killed they're just gonna go the

1203
01:38:15,239 --> 01:38:19,710
terrorblade again it worked last time
for them but now there's lien changes of

1204
01:38:19,710 --> 01:38:23,250
the other side where things yeah
so I don't know I think this is chapters

1205
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:28,800
versus TV matter is pretty hard for the
TV it should be a lot of damage if if TV

1206
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:34,200
is disabled they should be able to combo
potentially an enchantress can just

1207
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:38,370
chase down the TV and just saw take away
though illusions Equipe ruling his farm

1208
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:44,070
what about the other way around
reflection against the OD heroes did the

1209
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:49,740
reflections get bashes not sure anyways
that is the the draft for game number

1210
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:54,900
two here eg vs. og let's send it over
for an interview with sashka alright

1211
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:57,630
tell me how you're feeling about this
draft and how would you rate it compared

1212
01:38:57,630 --> 01:39:02,120
to what you did in Game one
buzzing about pretty fine drops twice

1213
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:06,870
you know I think we got a bit of up on
them so I'm playing Anakin oh yeah what

1214
01:39:06,870 --> 01:39:10,950
did you say to your team to help them
reset heading into this game I mean we

1215
01:39:10,950 --> 01:39:15,450
were ready for this we know it is a guy
team we're ready for to go see game so

1216
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:20,010
yeah I just had them to keep going you
all better yeah we'll see still

1217
01:39:20,010 --> 01:39:23,160
confident I love it
best of luck we'll talk to you soon

1218
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:29,520
fight back to you guys and we really are
looking for that they came to repeat

1219
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:35,100
history from last TI it was semi-final
to that these teams met up of course

1220
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:40,560
then it was og who to one down eg what
can happen this time around they're

1221
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:43,410
confident they're confident with the
trough this time around since there's a
couple of things that can have some

1222
01:39:44,490 --> 01:39:48,090
things work eg could win this game and
they're 200g could win this game then

1223
01:39:48,090 --> 01:39:51,480
they're 1 & 1 Wow
and then for the third game would you
believe it there's also 2 possible

1224
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:56,940
outcomes in that game so that would be
you know that if you do like a flowchart

1225
01:39:56,940 --> 01:40:00,960
of this it's really complicated but yeah
you'll figure it out eventually

1226
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:06,120
ok so I want to talk a little bit about
this game specifically The Enchantress

1227
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:10,190
pick that they were talking a little bit
about on the draft panel

1228
01:40:10,190 --> 01:40:13,850
I think they logic that EGR applying
this game that makes them pick the Tara

1229
01:40:13,850 --> 01:40:18,500
blade again is they want to carry that
first of all that farms really well when

1230
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:21,739
it's given space eg zeros are really
good at fighting early on outside of our

1231
01:40:21,739 --> 01:40:26,750
teases hero and sure interest has a good
matchup against terribly in the lane but

1232
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:30,469
terribly it isn't gonna Lane he's gonna
play there until he's level four or five

1233
01:40:30,469 --> 01:40:33,469
when it seems like enchantress the
starting to get scary it's gonna retreat

1234
01:40:33,469 --> 01:40:37,340
to the jungle and if enchantress starts
hunting terribly in the enemy jungle she

1235
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:41,180
can get ganked by gyro from mid that's
the whole idea here it can go deep into

1236
01:40:41,180 --> 01:40:44,690
the jungle he can play the opposite
jungle as well probably not the radiant
one but you know what I mean that around

1237
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:50,690
the triangle with terribly it and have a
good time for oh gee however you have

1238
01:40:50,690 --> 01:40:56,300
very big AoE spells and cooldowns and if
they don't connect on the Terra blade I

1239
01:40:56,300 --> 01:41:00,080
just seen his fights being relatively
free oh yeah what's actually killing

1240
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:02,600
this terribly in this game they don't
have heavy single target burst outside

1241
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:05,930
of enchantress
Tiny's okay for a while yeah but then

1242
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:09,380
what high knees damage late-game is
physical what happens if you can't kill

1243
01:41:09,380 --> 01:41:14,030
him before he can sub them that's that's
always yes it's like this that's your

1244
01:41:14,030 --> 01:41:17,390
first image from the tiny which starts
to wear off after a while but they do

1245
01:41:17,390 --> 01:41:20,150
have really great combinations maybe
this is the reason why socially just
feel so confident like we always look at

1246
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:25,370
the thing that works with the coronary
lot longer the days that we do sue

1247
01:41:25,370 --> 01:41:29,900
there's the skyrest page now we trust we
toss trees you have Compson we can do

1248
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:33,290
insane amount of damage and written
chant rest' who can make the most of

1249
01:41:33,290 --> 01:41:37,190
that control arrogant to with the work
with the impetus she can throw out like

1250
01:41:37,190 --> 01:41:40,310
there's just a lot of things that they
can work with birthday but i think

1251
01:41:40,310 --> 01:41:42,739
there's something very clear in what
you're saying to is the absolute
majority of the damage we're talking

1252
01:41:43,940 --> 01:41:47,480
about is physical or physical based
enchantress hits our physical attacks

1253
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:50,989
you can get evasion against it as
terribly the tree throw is physical you

1254
01:41:50,989 --> 01:41:54,890
get a lot of armor and terribly
naturally and void is more or less 100%

1255
01:41:54,890 --> 01:41:59,120
physical damage to so I think for the
name of the game for og here is play

1256
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:02,390
high tempo I don't think trading farm
when playing a slow game here is going

1257
01:42:02,390 --> 01:42:05,920
to favor them in the long
your plants elder tight late game one of

1258
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:10,960
the stronger supports with the aura for
a lot of damage and of course let's not

1259
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:16,179
forget the mid hero for eg also scale
it's a giant yeah plenty of the way up

1260
01:42:16,179 --> 01:42:19,119
in the way of a game with bloodless -
and it's been one of the most popular

1261
01:42:19,119 --> 01:42:25,869
heroes of ti9 we get our lanes up so eg
running the safe lane the et and the

1262
01:42:25,869 --> 01:42:30,190
terrible tell wow that's a lot of damage
on - no doubt she's trying to back

1263
01:42:30,190 --> 01:42:33,550
himself up the Oracle as Norton will
save you went fortune in to begin with

1264
01:42:33,550 --> 01:42:37,349
head into the trees only tango is to
bring his life back up again at s4

1265
01:42:37,349 --> 01:42:40,119
copping the same kind of damage from an
ax
no tell use the fortune femme to secure

1266
01:42:42,429 --> 01:42:45,400
range creep and no escort immediately
went for the fire blasts into arrow

1267
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:50,170
combination with crit something I don't
remember one the talent on the other

1268
01:42:50,170 --> 01:42:53,710
panel mentioned this that og should
probably look to get better lanes this

1269
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:59,230
time around they're pulling all a cool
boy this is also not a very strong Lane
so once again they're at the they're

1270
01:43:01,329 --> 01:43:04,449
running the risk of getting pressure
pretty hard in this honor Lane their mid

1271
01:43:04,449 --> 01:43:07,480
lane is good though tiny is just a
flat-out strong laner in general and

1272
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:10,090
their other Lane enchantress shaker is
very strong

1273
01:43:10,090 --> 01:43:12,610
speaking of in chat wonder shaker
they're really good up in the face of
odd cz flying he did the poll that's why

1274
01:43:15,789 --> 01:43:18,219
they're underneath the talent said
trying to get as much damage in as

1275
01:43:18,219 --> 01:43:21,340
possible but that's easy they're trying
to bait him into using the metamorphosis

1276
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:25,179
leave a vision logged in mount for
potentially getting some kills on creeps

1277
01:43:25,179 --> 01:43:28,690
and one of them including the range
creep and he still refused to use it
he's been holding it back another small

1278
01:43:30,999 --> 01:43:35,320
thing is also the third the ward fission
fly he actually put a sentry ward down

1279
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:39,820
which is able to block the camp up on
the top so there's no pole for OG to

1280
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:43,749
work with and that century wood is only
barely out of range of the observer

1281
01:43:43,749 --> 01:43:47,260
water that's watching the stacking from
flying so just a fun finding game up on

1282
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:50,619
the north it's a pretty unusual play for
elder Titans to block a camp like this
yeah he's just he's he's too scared of

1283
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:56,440
The Enchantress pressure with the
enchants villain with for good reason if
SAP gets like satyr or a centaur there's

1284
01:43:59,829 --> 01:44:02,480
play combos that could give a kill on
the Artie's

1285
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:07,010
so this way he keeps on Isis a
metamorphosis has now finally been

1286
01:44:07,010 --> 01:44:11,990
burned from RTZ took until level three
he's got two points up in the conjure

1287
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:15,290
image so 70 Rex is holding back for the
moment

1288
01:44:15,290 --> 01:44:18,320
crits waiting for the next attack he's
waiting for some males homing missile to

1289
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:21,860
come ball at bottom lane s4 and Naruto
held him there their stick title

1290
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:27,170
semester he'll get back underneath the
tower close call as base to at least

1291
01:44:27,170 --> 01:44:31,640
make RIT feel like he has to move off
the lane he found the illusion room he's

1292
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:35,150
coming in with a selves as well so s4
will be back in fighting shape and no
tails out of mana

1293
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:40,370
he has no resources left so this Lane
now plays itself for eg they might even

1294
01:44:40,370 --> 01:44:44,570
get the kill here if they're if they
play it right be fast about it they're

1295
01:44:44,570 --> 01:44:47,810
focusing down on anima he can always
just time walk this off and he's got

1296
01:44:47,810 --> 01:44:52,940
those four stick charges no town's gone
bush crit s4 here comes your level to
five blast out while up on top once he

1297
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:57,920
just get away bit snort out it stunned
up into the tree line they have the

1298
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:01,250
damage and they have the vision and Adam
actually being given the live from

1299
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:04,820
Naruto that's all he could do at the end
of this here's something to make Ana's

1300
01:45:04,820 --> 01:45:12,320
lane work yeah it's not looking too hot
down here right now

1301
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:16,850
both safely nurse being punished but
terribly it's not having a free time the

1302
01:45:16,850 --> 01:45:20,630
void is not having a free time and
that's where there's just a fundamental

1303
01:45:20,630 --> 01:45:23,690
difference in these two carries get
terribly flaming stage is bad he's gonna
go jungle minute for our level 4 what's

1304
01:45:26,210 --> 01:45:30,410
more gonna do he has to lane he's stuck
down here and he's playing with an

1305
01:45:30,410 --> 01:45:33,560
Oracle who now had level 3 so no till is
a lot stronger now than before with the

1306
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:38,340
two points and purifying flames there is
some kill potential

1307
01:45:38,340 --> 01:45:42,480
of how similar was Hinchey for the rune
he doesn't get it it was really hoping
you what it says a haste rune for crit

1308
01:45:44,420 --> 01:45:48,030
one-third of his HP is up and running
but he's hoping to probably get the

1309
01:45:48,030 --> 01:45:52,230
arrow against Hopson ifs Amell could
just get a good homing missile off but

1310
01:45:52,230 --> 01:45:56,100
then again Thompson he's saying run on
top of some L with his own damage and

1311
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:59,100
Thompson is playing this lane as
expected he's winning against the mill

1312
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:02,880
this is a very tiny favorite matchup in
isolation early on just has way better

1313
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:09,510
base damage like was mentioned on the
panel but some L is it still he's still

1314
01:46:09,510 --> 01:46:12,780
doing all right but he's he's getting
denied for sure which is the problem
Thompson's gotta go for some damage here

1315
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:20,340
cutting it pretty close to mail make
this at the damage update patella

1316
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:23,700
Thompson makes a break for the tree line
the male can actually reach him Thompson

1317
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:27,600
doesn't have a manner for a toss away
but he's got tried in 10 seconds

1318
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:33,080
yeah Noir will get a bouncer room as
well unless fly he's coming over there's

1319
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:38,130
the tiny chair access done here and this
will be matter on the Tunney nil and

1320
01:46:38,130 --> 01:46:41,490
three ball over and shonda's up so fly
they saw it with the Avalanche since

1321
01:46:41,490 --> 01:46:46,350
moved over as well fly he can get one
punch in the ain't no one punch man be

1322
01:46:46,350 --> 01:46:52,880
very clearly placed the motel flag
staring him in the eyes when he thought

1323
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:58,989
get in their minds that's what RG lost

1324
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:04,520
and that's one thing you can't beaut
can't remove the flex and see Archie

1325
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:08,270
understand this they just get around it
enter an S for really going hammer and

1326
01:47:08,270 --> 01:47:13,610
tongs the bottom line note so let's
throw the four tubes in the star he's
giving us for something to think about

1327
01:47:14,780 --> 01:47:18,980
that s4 has got 900 HP getting your dog
get through this Erica and purchase

1328
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:24,949
blood loss stone
it's a it's a minor annoyance T's got

1329
01:47:24,949 --> 01:47:28,550
metamorphosis again no pressure into
that top tower over the territory a

1330
01:47:28,550 --> 01:47:31,219
protector in this game but on a single
point of damage has been done to that to

1331
01:47:31,219 --> 01:47:37,100
you on tower on top Chris trying to leap
himself away I see Topsham moving

1332
01:47:37,100 --> 01:47:39,800
arteries already uses combination the
observed wood gives them all the

1333
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:43,280
information they need Thompson two
seconds till toss is off cooldown crit

1334
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:47,300
leaps up a little bit further round now
goes for a short range error he doesn't

1335
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:51,170
have another leap above Thompson has
both avalanche and toxic head toss

1336
01:47:51,170 --> 01:47:59,880
available Thomas yeah top Simon is dead
so nicely done costumes thanks Dawson Oh

1337
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:04,590
artis is in trouble to the Iraq
Jarrett's able to get the double stone

1338
01:48:04,590 --> 01:48:08,639
fly couldn't do anything to help them
out the sofas already used now fly is

1339
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:12,150
moving into the tree lines he'll go for
another stop but G right just waves it
out Clark quickly this is that Chris

1340
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:18,599
pecan to play you're expecting to come
in from oh gee they play this ton

1341
01:48:18,599 --> 01:48:22,170
timings right they get the chains right
hand out against the lead to body block

1342
01:48:22,170 --> 01:48:26,429
as far in the tree you can slow it down
once again turns out it's never ending

1343
01:48:26,429 --> 01:48:30,719
fortunes n fur coat Awards s for the
sons at least on faces points on Man

1344
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:37,380
O'War keep this pressure up he's getting
good farm though on the void now the

1345
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:42,090
start was a bit tough he got pressured
but no tail brought extra region Crick

1346
01:48:42,090 --> 01:48:45,090
was roaming a little bit on the Murano
which gave on a more space and now they

1347
01:48:45,090 --> 01:48:49,710
might even kill us for here Phil I'm
very very oriented with no piranhas to

1348
01:48:49,710 --> 01:48:53,849
stay with him the princess of the food
is currently absent from the throne as

1349
01:48:53,849 --> 01:48:57,249
full
actually a view from north on the

1350
01:48:57,249 --> 01:49:01,780
Backstrom and we'll do the right Tom Wow
yes if he's low on line behind me miss

1351
01:49:01,780 --> 01:49:05,170
all will come to finish the job dear
I've tried to help out to Thompson ran

1352
01:49:05,170 --> 01:49:08,739
down our teases all the way to the j-3
and killed him
so this all dynamic is really

1353
01:49:10,659 --> 01:49:13,659
interesting because the enchantress will
not be chasing him but the tiny is one

1354
01:49:13,659 --> 01:49:16,840
of those heroes that can quickly push in
the mid lane to start making go and move

1355
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:20,709
for the enemy jungle and he can solo
kill terribly this early on terribly

1356
01:49:20,709 --> 01:49:24,039
there's no health
he's also got no net worth just for all

1357
01:49:24,039 --> 01:49:27,880
net worth brough you see him he's fought
from the bottom not even mm to this

1358
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:33,840
narrow place named es currently has more
net worth on the support cheer axe

1359
01:49:37,490 --> 01:49:41,750
Thompson does not get the ring yet it's
bought him he probably trying to run

1360
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:44,330
down and take this region after pushing
out mid he knows it's there and then

1361
01:49:44,330 --> 01:49:48,170
it's there's nobody going to take it
right now it said the illusion to deny

1362
01:49:48,170 --> 01:49:49,850
it
yeah and he sent his hero into the other

1363
01:49:49,850 --> 01:49:53,810
side of the jungle but now he's gonna
maybe get smoked outs or if he dies

1364
01:49:53,810 --> 01:49:58,850
again this all could scan from Dyer the
big lights is happening they just follow

1365
01:49:58,850 --> 01:50:02,210
the illusion they put down the
protection now it's easy he needs space

1366
01:50:02,210 --> 01:50:05,090
he needs time and Thompson doesn't want
to give manthe they leave an observed

1367
01:50:05,090 --> 01:50:09,680
what back behind the tier 2 Tower to
your ex is waiting on the hill at easy

1368
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:13,790
be set upon on all sides
the courier's coming out to deliver the

1369
01:50:13,790 --> 01:50:18,050
roadbed hey guys I think I know where he
is he's in the trees but you'll lose the

1370
01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:22,370
enchanted fellow that's going go Prince
able to get him while edgy and looking

1371
01:50:22,370 --> 01:50:26,060
the other way
SEMCOG greeting and don't friends talk

1372
01:50:26,060 --> 01:50:29,900
about it though finally they found it
drop the newts drop the hammer
that's easy they want to stay on top of

1373
01:50:33,110 --> 01:50:36,590
them it's not playing dota right now why
it's also in trouble in the back lines

1374
01:50:36,590 --> 01:50:41,720
t-rex chased him into the trees that top
fight took its tall chair axis needs to

1375
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:46,370
hit him once and fly you can keep moving
around the rock wall around the tree but

1376
01:50:46,370 --> 01:50:50,960
your axis totem it has the reach while
Hana he has the actual life getting to

1377
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:58,520
hit time up don't toss him down - they
have - damn it between the two chords it

1378
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:00,710
is looking spicy Roach here right now
that is true

1379
01:51:00,710 --> 01:51:03,590
their landing stage I was skeptical on
the start especially about this bottom

1380
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:05,690
lane but things are looking great right
now
mainly because our teeth these econ

1381
01:51:12,380 --> 01:51:15,440
cross at top lane except in real trouble
in the middle of a call down the
attendance will not help him the army

1382
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:21,130
from Samoa we'll wipe that smile off his
face while flight comes the tier 2 Tower

1383
01:51:21,130 --> 01:51:25,480
grx and talks and once again come Boeing
together than the smash brothers right
now s4 as well as ought to easy the TP 3

1384
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:33,130
[Applause]

1385
01:51:34,439 --> 01:51:37,959
odhh you're playing really really good
daughter right now and now the roads as
well they have look perfect we don't

1386
01:51:39,369 --> 01:51:43,030
what they need to do in the game with
this tiny I think Thompson is having a

1387
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:46,329
huge game impact right now even if he
doesn't kill arteezy's just ruining his

1388
01:51:46,329 --> 01:51:50,349
game look what he's doing
and I had the double damage rune he just

1389
01:51:50,349 --> 01:51:53,559
wants to go on towards easy but the tire
observer Ward it scattered out the

1390
01:51:53,559 --> 01:51:57,189
movement so with the DD rune he won't
get the dilip into chronosphere and it

1391
01:51:57,189 --> 01:52:01,869
was probably looking for we've been
talking a lot about are there other two
parts are not looking too shabby

1392
01:52:03,419 --> 01:52:08,439
gyrocopter almost talked networth ochre
is ahead of the enchantress here we go

1393
01:52:08,439 --> 01:52:11,440
again
talk to me oh dear
[Applause]

1394
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:18,520
don't tell the elf the worst thing can
you even blame him they'd like smoked

1395
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:23,370
him two or three times and deep ones

1396
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:28,860
taking 50% of the killer

1397
01:52:30,119 --> 01:52:35,040
Thompson how fast can this guy be
enabled phase boots out move through the

1398
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:40,260
trade and none the fidget block t-rex
this is wild support yet he is one of

1399
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:48,150
the greatest and annotating the tier 1
tower to boost keep him out of lane the
shadows will take eg the walk in the

1400
01:52:50,699 --> 01:52:54,630
shadows Grantham the observer Ward
Thompson he actually deplored that he

1401
01:52:54,630 --> 01:53:00,780
had the radiance century there now AG's
even lost the vision and they've got G

1402
01:53:00,780 --> 01:53:05,750
racks right behind him they're ready to
fight on bottom lane the radiant century

1403
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:10,619
and weren't even matter then waited at
the time the observed would didn't see

1404
01:53:10,619 --> 01:53:14,130
it sees some elf or a half barman as
well that sports a blended options of

1405
01:53:14,130 --> 01:53:17,730
engine from t-rex bar officers pulled
out bull arrived tops and then finally
can it has this free

1406
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:24,150
that's a long backup the t1 town it is
indeed

1407
01:53:24,150 --> 01:53:28,020
that's the comeback mechanic six undergo
and a stop net worth and they're gonna

1408
01:53:28,020 --> 01:53:31,740
immediately smoke again oh gee have no
vision here so they don't know this is
happening this is not the easiest smoke

1409
01:53:34,170 --> 01:53:37,710
to predict but if they want cross the
entire map maybe it will be predicted

1410
01:53:37,710 --> 01:53:41,460
okay the topper in in bisman they're not
gonna grab this I think they're looking

1411
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:45,660
for Anna but well Derek says she broke
the smoke is already tp'ing um towards

1412
01:53:45,660 --> 01:53:49,080
the shrine he understands that something
shady is happening Derek saw the room

1413
01:53:49,080 --> 01:53:52,860
get taken here I think this might blow
this gank from og butt-head Allah when

1414
01:53:52,860 --> 01:53:57,230
they grabbed this room no he's still
under arms

1415
01:54:04,430 --> 01:54:09,690
Derek's pin get out he set the runes
gone and all of you choose hers were
missing but Anna still stuck the routes

1416
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:15,030
upon the camp bit greedy probably felt
he was safe to having the observed

1417
01:54:15,030 --> 01:54:18,540
loaded the length and as he said like
they would smoke up from the bottom lane

1418
01:54:18,540 --> 01:54:21,480
and not just run directly at him and
that space far too easy

1419
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:25,410
they've reestablished some control in
this top area so terribly gets to play a

1420
01:54:25,410 --> 01:54:31,950
little bit now they still way behind par
for course on this hero but slowly

1421
01:54:31,950 --> 01:54:36,750
recovering and OG they're gonna keep up
the pressure they will keep playing fast

1422
01:54:36,750 --> 01:54:40,860
they have the same read that playing
this slow and letting EG get space is

1423
01:54:40,860 --> 01:54:44,250
not the way to go it's a great day my
dad bought down Tommy so this is coming

1424
01:54:44,250 --> 01:54:46,889
a cook take away from free will create
space over

1425
01:54:46,889 --> 01:54:51,459
bicha something esoteric actually turns
dump the arrow and maybe a little bit

1426
01:54:51,459 --> 01:54:54,609
too late the call down it's breakfast
Mountain playing from inside the trees

1427
01:54:54,609 --> 01:54:58,209
with a black gonna damage Jarek that's a
bonafide Thompson he'll have to say from
3,000 grx more beans are lofty 9ss fault

1428
01:55:01,119 --> 01:55:04,780
birth dying over on the opposite sides
of the lane and Thompson finally now

1429
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:09,609
back up to full health just tosses away
the juror comes up at easy has arrived

1430
01:55:09,609 --> 01:55:14,019
it up against Seth is not the hero he
wants to fight but as eg do this chase

1431
01:55:14,019 --> 01:55:18,609
the Dyer observed award that og ran out
under is what helped them set up for

1432
01:55:18,609 --> 01:55:23,739
this fight I'm not finding anything else
13 minute 40 min to Hannah - in here for
Vanna meanwhile on the northern side of

1433
01:55:27,249 --> 01:55:31,530
the lane he was just again not involved
was just farming farming farming farming

1434
01:55:31,530 --> 01:55:36,579
keeps ramping up a lot of the times you
would like your voice ooh at least use

1435
01:55:36,579 --> 01:55:39,729
the coronal when it's off cooldown then
you can go back to farming but not even

1436
01:55:39,729 --> 01:55:44,679
bad Terence Fisher actually oh he's a
male up to the high ground with the et

1437
01:55:44,679 --> 01:55:49,629
split up Dotel is no safe to this at all
meanwhile Anna does he want to go for a

1438
01:55:49,629 --> 01:55:54,189
solar killing us easy he's got their
damage he actually has nothing brutal

1439
01:55:54,189 --> 01:55:57,639
and shudders beat but so they can all
just walk away or they're gonna walk

1440
01:55:57,639 --> 01:56:00,389
into topside

1441
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:12,000
the

1442
01:56:24,390 --> 01:56:29,770
the divine the creep never hit the deck
the Thompsons not done you know he's

1443
01:56:29,770 --> 01:56:41,320
never done our tendrán they're running
for it up on ba ya know TZ never go for
stuff to the t1 town to attack talks

1444
01:56:42,820 --> 01:56:46,930
especially wrapping around the side but
all you'll find his illusions kindly

1445
01:56:46,930 --> 01:56:51,340
that topped our take some damage but
they here for the bounty is too here for

1446
01:56:51,340 --> 01:56:55,240
the money
and now our TZ is catching up to a boy

1447
01:56:55,240 --> 01:57:00,430
would you believe it he was sold far
behind but this last sequence from eg is

1448
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:04,750
massive they defend their tower down
though they F win for validity two to

1449
01:57:04,750 --> 01:57:06,940
one
it's a good terribly game what can I say

1450
01:57:06,940 --> 01:57:11,110
they've been shutting him down as hard
as they could but one misstep one over

1451
01:57:11,110 --> 01:57:15,580
extension and that finger chrono play it
just failed we're just not in the right

1452
01:57:15,580 --> 01:57:20,110
position with their heroes said it's
just gonna okay he's gonna get arrow but

1453
01:57:20,110 --> 01:57:24,670
not get compote down they won't get the
deny on this Midtown most likely it's a

1454
01:57:24,670 --> 01:57:28,780
fantastic observer and sentry down from
eg they actually saw Thompson coming in

1455
01:57:28,780 --> 01:57:32,230
with the blink dagger so the reveal was
actually found by the observer warden

1456
01:57:32,230 --> 01:57:36,220
but you do have this double job this
feels like a way that og can do battle

1457
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:39,390
those two to one odds

1458
01:57:40,210 --> 01:57:44,210
we need to see a lot more action out of
Thompson I think he's playing an

1459
01:57:44,210 --> 01:57:48,740
integral role right now in the game his
one overextension second overextension

1460
01:57:48,740 --> 01:57:54,940
he got saved by OG by no-tell but you've
got to be you've got to be on your toes

1461
01:57:54,940 --> 01:57:59,150
sitting back it's not the play right now
still but it still feels like he's

1462
01:57:59,150 --> 01:58:02,900
waiting for Hannah to be ready like yeah
you gotta be fighting you're gonna be

1463
01:58:02,900 --> 01:58:07,160
looking for kills but how long until Ana
will actually come into these fights how

1464
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:11,270
long until they look for the combination
errored Thompson's in the trees he's

1465
01:58:11,270 --> 01:58:17,270
fine got rid of the siege creep just
saving some HP on the tower t-rex is

1466
01:58:17,270 --> 01:58:20,000
gonna get his blink dagger on bottom
lane as well they want to kill some male

1467
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:23,420
he's such a huge Kelley 7 and 0 if they
know this kill streak is extremely

1468
01:58:23,420 --> 01:58:29,960
valuable and he's gonna buy confident
you've got crit right behind ana

1469
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:33,290
moonlight shadow instantly bunt
the second Thompson jumped out the tree

1470
01:58:33,290 --> 01:58:39,100
lines they went for it and crit he's
talking him into the trough he be big

1471
01:58:40,230 --> 01:58:44,380
didn't you simply ah he thought he
quelling crew uh-huh

1472
01:58:44,380 --> 01:58:48,070
well he doesn't have a quality whoa I
don't know about all right

1473
01:58:48,070 --> 01:58:50,920
probably yeah he old my thought it
perhaps or I thought the blink dagger

1474
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:54,460
was still ready whatever it was he got
out mid lane we're gonna have a sleep

1475
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:58,270
but they're not going to be able to
combo to point natures and tangents and

1476
01:58:58,270 --> 01:59:02,170
three points untouchable said we're
gonna stick around and attempt to denial

1477
01:59:02,170 --> 01:59:06,190
fly how I like that from set he waited
it out and flying he's gonna get
punished looking for that denial as for

1478
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:10,960
gonna go for his own something to talk
to him for the future is there from

1479
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:14,440
t-rex but they can't keep the pressure
up just yet but goal down from some out

1480
01:59:14,440 --> 01:59:18,910
creating more space for the Ergo sense
willing to run into it but for how long

1481
01:59:18,910 --> 01:59:23,320
and now the tossed tiny pulling back as
long arrow flies for it hits on the

1482
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:27,160
attention he's protected and Thompson
he'll actually have the extra life

1483
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:30,790
through the false promise the flak
cannon from smell as much damage as he

1484
01:59:30,790 --> 01:59:35,200
can they'll start him up and now maybe
with the impetus they have enough damage

1485
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:40,240
top on goal he just missed the talkback
and the extra stop Madeira don't bring

1486
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:45,380
it
[Applause]

1487
01:59:55,660 --> 02:00:01,160
finally they bring down the yard but it
caused so much

1488
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:05,720
oh there's forecast think they can't be
happy with that Oh G Thompson plankton

1489
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:08,960
tries to get the tossing gyro doesn't
get a second attempt he tosses out the

1490
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:14,990
shaker I think wasn't that what he did I
think that's what I did that was really

1491
02:00:14,990 --> 02:00:17,960
chaotic but it looked like you tossed
out the shaker we can look at it again

1492
02:00:17,960 --> 02:00:19,400
in a second he's looking for another
jump

1493
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:23,540
avalanche toss combination body with a
double damage rune Thompson able just to

1494
02:00:23,540 --> 02:00:27,200
get the kill on the fly get something
back here but yeah have another look at

1495
02:00:27,200 --> 02:00:32,330
that fight and seeing the series of
events and testily feels like such a

1496
02:00:32,330 --> 02:00:37,310
hard run for OG but hey though he were
down to 33% win odds right now it's

1497
02:00:37,310 --> 02:00:43,210
gonna be hard to matter what they timed
up a bit it's looking better and spicy

1498
02:00:43,210 --> 02:00:47,900
print will however be getting the spirit
missile now it's going to help them have

1499
02:00:47,900 --> 02:00:51,440
options so here you go there's the
enchant eco combo there it is who tosses

1500
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:55,360
him out they both get slept the splitter
comes down the middle

1501
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:58,850
fortunately for OGG terrible aid is not
useful right now when it comes to

1502
02:00:58,850 --> 02:01:01,640
fighting so they don't get punished
harder than that because it's only the

1503
02:01:01,640 --> 02:01:06,390
board heroes but more space for rtz
he is still gaming in this game and some

1504
02:01:06,390 --> 02:01:10,440
male staying alive is really really big
for them he's such a valuable kill they
get the over it's something but he's

1505
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:17,220
actually lower net worth than his
piranha now as far as still aiming for

1506
02:01:17,220 --> 02:01:22,440
20 minute - that's of course they can
smell it some al wants to kill on bottom
lane

1507
02:01:23,180 --> 02:01:28,800
no it's 9:00 time that's why they didn't
see Naruto the protection is there and

1508
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:31,760
you'll have to use his earn old when the
false promise trying to escape from this

1509
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:36,270
illusion he's owning the time to
actually heal up in the tree line gerrae

1510
02:01:36,270 --> 02:01:42,540
won't be fined anyway yeah looked like
print might want to try to chase him
there so males gonna see him no there's

1511
02:01:45,090 --> 02:01:50,070
a tree man got the tree easy that exam
oh now you'll see him told you who's

1512
02:01:50,070 --> 02:01:53,610
gonna see him the point daggits up cool
down blink Carver but hey crits over

1513
02:01:53,610 --> 02:01:57,630
here let's so it's Naruto
so now if he wants to try and change it

1514
02:01:57,630 --> 02:02:01,320
there's a lot of help it's head hit by
that long stun duration of crit

1515
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:06,600
sorry still wanting to play catch send a
lot of defensive heroes here to keep

1516
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:13,090
Schafer safe
they do manage but that's about all to

1517
02:02:13,090 --> 02:02:16,480
come out from that it has to be the
slowest - for an ogre I've seen its
various - aw thanks easy this will be a

1518
02:02:18,580 --> 02:02:22,030
huge kill for Thompson even loving
Avalanche

1519
02:02:22,030 --> 02:02:25,080
tall seeds Annika

1520
02:02:27,649 --> 02:02:31,610
Thompson's down for the count Artesia
knew his limits who saw Thompson wasn't
completely convinced to be good killer

1521
02:02:32,989 --> 02:02:36,469
so he started hitting him first before
going for the Avatar scramble to get him

1522
02:02:36,469 --> 02:02:40,070
low enough but even then it was still
not enough arteezy with the strength

1523
02:02:40,070 --> 02:02:45,519
[Applause]
to create the gym

1524
02:02:45,519 --> 02:02:54,349
oh that's so bad news for them rtz got
the kill on tops and that's another 425

1525
02:02:54,349 --> 02:02:58,539
goal he almost has BKB now these two
kills in mid lane some male they're just

1526
02:02:58,539 --> 02:03:02,749
they're progressing so well in the game
and all of this while again Colonel is

1527
02:03:02,749 --> 02:03:08,179
ready there how many crows have they
used this game like one two yeah 132 I

1528
02:03:08,179 --> 02:03:11,360
am here to mid lane and mid like golden
bird shot

1529
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:14,749
I think was good too I remember this is
a 21 minute game where onna actually had

1530
02:03:14,749 --> 02:03:17,840
a pretty good laning stage we thought it
was gonna get harder than it was and I

1531
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:21,710
think oh gee kind of need him they make
moves the logic that they're playing the

1532
02:03:21,710 --> 02:03:25,219
void with was just staying out of fights
and farming a lot he is a hard carry but

1533
02:03:25,219 --> 02:03:29,510
you have to consider what you're giving
away by doing this this is the time that

1534
02:03:29,510 --> 02:03:32,300
your line of is supposed to peep or
you're the ones who are supposed to make

1535
02:03:32,300 --> 02:03:35,719
the moves and I'm fine with him AFK
farming improvements on hold on

1536
02:03:35,719 --> 02:03:39,230
absolutely I don't think I don't think I
should be looking for fights with time
dilation and only that and the time walk

1537
02:03:41,210 --> 02:03:45,710
button down his team needs him right now
meanwhile Nietzsche continues to bomb

1538
02:03:45,710 --> 02:03:48,769
some bales go back at him set to the
maelstroms coming out in the Korea a

1539
02:03:48,769 --> 02:03:52,519
full BKB is now arrived for the
terrorblade set trying to go on to s

1540
02:03:52,519 --> 02:03:56,300
fall at hand - well at least he got it
off before he died finesse falls down

1541
02:03:56,300 --> 02:04:02,719
once again moon lion shudder from eg did
not arrive in time and toxin just one

1542
02:04:02,719 --> 02:04:08,239
small walking up blindly uphill the Sam
I'll be ready to fight this Korea
solisten brought his item to him but

1543
02:04:09,860 --> 02:04:12,789
they weren't Cara Compton

1544
02:04:26,710 --> 02:04:33,170
from eg TOEFL like dominoes there we go
that's the big fight for Mooji that they

1545
02:04:33,170 --> 02:04:37,370
were waiting for of awesome April from
jaracz and you just see the ball through

1546
02:04:37,370 --> 02:04:41,390
Boyd whoreson vault this time gets an
easy double kill with the chrono and SEF

1547
02:04:41,390 --> 02:04:46,340
ends the streak of the gyro getting 800
gold closing in on his beat baby and our

1548
02:04:46,340 --> 02:04:49,130
TV happy kid either
he just didn't get it off yeah he got

1549
02:04:49,130 --> 02:04:53,500
surprised by the stuns got blown up all
that magic damage from the shaker

1550
02:04:53,500 --> 02:04:59,290
currently is enough later on it will be
harder but for now he gets the jump done

1551
02:04:59,290 --> 02:05:03,290
probably thought he had the full
advantage and this is this is danger

1552
02:05:03,290 --> 02:05:08,210
zone for eg the items will start to roll
in he said like you look towards the BKB

1553
02:05:08,210 --> 02:05:11,360
for the Enchantress but I'm looking to
was the academic scepter of Thompson

1554
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:15,020
what happens when this corner starts to
be amplified more than just an ins

1555
02:05:15,020 --> 02:05:20,770
Mjolnir attack he's going for his own
BKB - yep

1556
02:05:21,360 --> 02:05:27,090
Terrax we'll get a full stop Laura tells
looking for earn charges makes items on

1557
02:05:27,090 --> 02:05:32,850
the wish list but eg just want to kill a
ball else mark up all together on oh no

1558
02:05:32,850 --> 02:05:36,090
echo this is the time to take a good
fight they have metamorphosis as well

1559
02:05:36,090 --> 02:05:39,060
they might just force broken it go
Roshan today break this mark garden

1560
02:05:39,060 --> 02:05:43,380
nurse house is a little bit too far away
so they slip inside the pit and oh jeez

1561
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:53,070
been checking for a while Shawn said 50%
side gunner Ichi spirits down is walking

1562
02:05:53,070 --> 02:05:57,300
out that may be another upset but it's
already done eg under the cover of the

1563
02:05:57,300 --> 02:06:01,590
moonlight shadow will walk out of the
Rose pit with the agate of receptor agus

1564
02:06:01,590 --> 02:06:06,540
the immortal gyrocopter ready to fight
that's a great play for all right no G

1565
02:06:06,540 --> 02:06:09,210
you've got a good team fight with your
Ultimates now we're gonna get something

1566
02:06:09,210 --> 02:06:12,210
for free and I think Oh jeah thank you
that this Rose was happening I don't

1567
02:06:12,210 --> 02:06:15,030
even know if they would have come there
that fight is extremely hard to take

1568
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:17,969
your fight against elder titan in the
pit Bessemer onna that can arrow you

1569
02:06:17,969 --> 02:06:21,330
from all angles and you don't have your
big spells to kill the terribly with so

1570
02:06:21,330 --> 02:06:24,510
now each you have to smoke and go again
that's kind of like that choice I'm not

1571
02:06:24,510 --> 02:06:30,030
seeing a spark on anyone from eg I think
they want to chill until terribly miss
met again Oh terribly it's gonna jump

1572
02:06:31,739 --> 02:06:35,070
that's not what they want to happen the
arrow flies forward it done this you can

1573
02:06:35,070 --> 02:06:39,030
try go under Oh give me free
they'll still offering that protect you

1574
02:06:39,030 --> 02:06:42,510
for the funny the et stomp is out and
there's nothing much you can do Titans

1575
02:06:42,510 --> 02:06:45,600
at the sleep through this battle Connie
oh snap does the protection is now

1576
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:49,830
falling off EEG route from one time to
the next attempt car too much hit banana

1577
02:06:49,830 --> 02:06:53,580
he can't burners off CUDA he beamed the
crap out of the orga that's a lot of

1578
02:06:53,580 --> 02:06:56,030
crap together

1579
02:06:57,390 --> 02:07:01,560
ana don't discount the sparkly shields
able just to bounce it off with the prop

1580
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:07,860
to get the kill on s4 terribly couldn't
rejoin and I think oh gee all things
considered there with the kill failing

1581
02:07:09,630 --> 02:07:13,350
to begin with getting Sunter off on the
terribly they'll take that one for one

1582
02:07:13,350 --> 02:07:18,230
trade that could have got her way worse
and still having a car still have it for
Iraq he's ready to jump

1583
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:26,990
[Applause]

1584
02:07:32,490 --> 02:07:37,360
so much damage and that time there was
no Oracle safe didn't have the false

1585
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:41,320
promise it was on cooldown and on a farm
Depok wrestling got punished

1586
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:48,550
EGR fast they're really quick to exploit
openings in this game and while their

1587
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:51,340
lead might not be that big in terms of
the network you have this feeling that

1588
02:07:51,340 --> 02:07:55,030
their game plan is just progressing
nicely from these extra little pics they

1589
02:07:55,030 --> 02:07:57,670
find here and there
the terribly it's learning to get some

1590
02:07:57,670 --> 02:08:02,080
more health sange and Yasha completed
now he's gonna farm and get the hell out

1591
02:08:02,080 --> 02:08:05,800
of here blinked into the trees dodge his
TP that ping exactly where he is but no

1592
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:08,200
one can reach him
I'm loving this bubble swell forever

1593
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:13,810
yeah give him the on cane get the push
going yeah metal ready in five so you

1594
02:08:13,810 --> 02:08:19,140
imagine our team is still looking for
that tiny they didn't figure out of TP

1595
02:08:19,140 --> 02:08:24,940
fun item for the yurga no orange for
this are good blink dagger head of - and
fly

1596
02:08:25,390 --> 02:08:30,900
give us some scream Nana all right yep
that's that's that happens

1597
02:08:32,409 --> 02:08:38,050
I've seen that look on someone's face
before it's the hot fuck face

1598
02:08:39,070 --> 02:08:44,180
didn't seem to give that with the EPS
don't huh like well just get back to it

1599
02:08:44,180 --> 02:08:47,240
again right like hey too far that's the
way to go
oh geez Spirit has been seemingly

1600
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:54,200
unbreakable but if this continues they
might lose a series - oh and then we'll

1601
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:58,310
see how unbreakable it will be in the
lower bracket but game they need to look

1602
02:08:58,310 --> 02:09:02,360
for a fight they have all those spells
Colonels up tiny combos up unless they
want to wait for an item

1603
02:09:06,670 --> 02:09:12,950
Thompson continues to walk with envision
it continues to get picked off he was

1604
02:09:12,950 --> 02:09:19,250
like eight and one at one point now he's
11 and four that's not the same momentum

1605
02:09:19,250 --> 02:09:23,900
style drop the og was looking for out of
Thompson and it's a big kill our TZ has

1606
02:09:23,900 --> 02:09:27,470
the are Cameron caught with the meta so
they will definitely be looking to do

1607
02:09:27,470 --> 02:09:30,020
some damage to those mid tier 2 Tower
still with the aegis and hand on some

1608
02:09:30,020 --> 02:09:34,430
male scouting arrow will not find
anything but don't think og are

1609
02:09:34,430 --> 02:09:38,000
interested in trying to defend this
sorry they actually need 200 gold ana is

1610
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:42,020
trying to farm it up inside the jungle
to get his BKB now it's a hundred gold

1611
02:09:42,020 --> 02:09:45,290
so time Walker but all that's not
helping he doesn't rolling blade he
actually has to wait out his next time

1612
02:09:46,580 --> 02:09:52,019
long time but it's ok he's only gonna
take the tier 2 Tower in the meantime

1613
02:09:52,019 --> 02:09:57,130
but don't worry no one saw her
I wonder what our tease is going next if

1614
02:09:57,130 --> 02:10:01,570
he wants to go Scottie okay let's go
butterfly cuz both of the items given

1615
02:10:01,570 --> 02:10:05,440
really really pro to HP in this game the
butterfly giving the evasion against

1616
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:09,750
both the Enchantress impetus against the
boy and of course against is it a tiny

1617
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:16,930
the tiny tree throw the agility armor
still adds up and he will go butter over

1618
02:10:16,930 --> 02:10:22,360
the Scottie favors the just like its
overall tankiness I feel like it's
comparable in this game I think a Scotty

1619
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:26,710
and a butterfly will fit roughly maybe
the butter will even give him more

1620
02:10:26,710 --> 02:10:31,120
health against these heroes and threats
switch on to strength you will have

1621
02:10:31,120 --> 02:10:38,080
about 2.2 K health leader you could
normally say I hate why not both but if

1622
02:10:38,080 --> 02:10:41,020
I don't you get one good fine he may not
have that option for the second it's

1623
02:10:41,020 --> 02:10:46,840
true Odie's line aha OTR absolutely not
out of it yet this game is over hey you

1624
02:10:46,840 --> 02:10:49,900
got Tony beating the crap out of a tier
2 tau as no one's here from eg to fight
this Nana will come in to help out as

1625
02:10:52,030 --> 02:10:56,110
well with the BKB completed the combo is
up from rog Ichi does have to give it

1626
02:10:56,110 --> 02:10:59,530
some level of respect the thing oh do
you need to make sure of is that they

1627
02:10:59,530 --> 02:11:02,980
find a way of combining their shaker and
Boyd effectively one of the weaknesses

1628
02:11:02,980 --> 02:11:05,470
of this pairing is that to an extent
they do the same thing in the fight

1629
02:11:05,470 --> 02:11:08,140
shaker wants to blink echo and stun lock
down people

1630
02:11:08,140 --> 02:11:11,410
Boyd wants to blink chrono or jump in
Colonel and do the same thing but they
can't do it on top of each other it

1631
02:11:12,490 --> 02:11:15,940
needs to be delayed and if they get the
idea at the same time it can be a

1632
02:11:15,940 --> 02:11:20,230
disaster if they layer it perfectly it's
super nice so gotta pay good attention

1633
02:11:20,230 --> 02:11:25,890
to how the fights start off this is a
lot of patience from eg on the top lane

1634
02:11:25,890 --> 02:11:30,900
how long do they hold this
no one's coming to defend the t1 tower
all right maybe we should push it Eugene

1635
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:39,840
yep 30-minute bounty runes but in half
and half and another arcane ruin this is

1636
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:44,940
bread and butter for terror blades well
maybe yes the corner to actually save at
the fish' holds about the fall stock

1637
02:11:46,650 --> 02:12:11,910
pushes him away to the beach they have
to make sure the detection was already

1638
02:12:11,910 --> 02:12:17,670
maybe with the passion they have another
toast available down Igor's 30 they're

1639
02:12:17,670 --> 02:12:25,909
dangerous they buy order acts
[Applause]

1640
02:12:27,120 --> 02:12:32,770
bit of a pickle leave the way home maybe
the pickle off the burger treetops gonna

1641
02:12:32,770 --> 02:12:37,630
be on target printers really he's moving
around the tree tops we're in the into

1642
02:12:37,630 --> 02:12:41,440
the side till the buy back door you want
Bob ten he's falling for the wrong
direction

1643
02:12:42,160 --> 02:12:45,640
recruits outlaw but they're pushing the
Midtown off while all this is going on

1644
02:12:45,640 --> 02:12:50,320
trim which is playing around the side
but Anna playing objective based gaming
with og they used the entering the fader

1645
02:12:52,840 --> 02:12:55,630
room face rather twenty minute Bob but
they'll still do it at thirty one and

1646
02:12:55,630 --> 02:12:59,440
remember what said all of this off was
in our team room Artesia wanted that
room to get the metamorphoses efficiency

1647
02:13:01,150 --> 02:13:04,870
and it ended up setting up og our
perfect team fight till later out the

1648
02:13:04,870 --> 02:13:07,990
room well and they're going to be
rewarded handsomely they get the full

1649
02:13:07,990 --> 02:13:11,740
Lane of racks from this it looks like it
looks like it and then they can just

1650
02:13:11,740 --> 02:13:16,030
back off preset by their items they're
not gonna complete the rocks that might

1651
02:13:16,030 --> 02:13:19,630
be defendable t-rex just buys a little
bit of space bling forward heads for

1652
02:13:19,630 --> 02:13:24,550
going on to t-rex there is bulk Chronos
now all cool down and they did get the

1653
02:13:24,550 --> 02:13:28,000
full length they didn't stop the secret
from attacking escort went for the

1654
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:31,630
aggressive stun look at the money as
well mkb Gulf completed already

1655
02:13:31,630 --> 02:13:36,730
do you still gara tzm for the butterfly
i think you might want to change his
plan now and go Scotty I think now it's

1656
02:13:38,500 --> 02:13:43,360
I don't think he sendeth are like in the
quick ye still that butterfly is he

1657
02:13:43,360 --> 02:13:46,990
gonna fire the eager song as he walks
past EST years okay so they say didn't

1658
02:13:46,990 --> 02:13:52,530
get the information on Anna he doesn't
buy back now that's bold

1659
02:13:52,900 --> 02:13:57,530
they need to keep these lanes pushed out
and by by RTC at the time to pump look

1660
02:13:57,530 --> 02:14:01,520
at the swing and wind expectancy we've
just had on that XP graph over the last

1661
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:07,430
five minutes oh gee have swung this game
by almost 50 percent from eg having

1662
02:14:07,430 --> 02:14:13,040
about almost 80 so now oh gee have about
60 all these combinations selling to

1663
02:14:13,040 --> 02:14:16,400
arrive for ho chi gives you confidence
going into the teamfights as long as

1664
02:14:16,400 --> 02:14:20,480
they're off cooldown but I gotta say man
I'm loving this jurrac see yes more than

1665
02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:25,070
I was loving the es in the first game he
is just being everywhere he feels

1666
02:14:25,070 --> 02:14:29,210
sacrificial but he's never properly
sacrificed was able to live change done

1667
02:14:29,210 --> 02:14:32,360
perfectly
scouting ro won't find anybody medli the

1668
02:14:32,360 --> 02:14:36,620
C's for a moment no tell that's a big
thing about this this comic emoji when

1669
02:14:36,620 --> 02:14:40,550
is that like he has all these good chain
stunts they don't have a save on an

1670
02:14:40,550 --> 02:14:44,000
Aegis lineup oh gee they have the Oracle
team to save people again in trouble

1671
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:48,680
eg however if RTZ gets caught in Colonel
the only say that they have for him is

1672
02:14:48,680 --> 02:14:52,430
trying to stomp some heroes on the enemy
team but you're not stomping this B can

1673
02:14:52,430 --> 02:14:56,030
be void you're not stomping the BKB n so
poor you're gonna stop like these are
the guys killing him right now he's a

1674
02:14:58,670 --> 02:15:04,490
ghost busters hurricane plank turtley
Donnelly enchantress eg they're smirking

1675
02:15:04,490 --> 02:15:06,530
up to move out this cooks be abort
mission

1676
02:15:06,530 --> 02:15:12,110
they do have two of them on fly I need
to get planted as we look towards Roshan

1677
02:15:12,110 --> 02:15:17,600
counter he will respawn in 30 seconds
anna is more d having a peak time

1678
02:15:17,600 --> 02:15:24,200
walking into the pit smart won't break
sentries down but it's the observer what
behind them that's giving the

1679
02:15:25,850 --> 02:15:29,850
information per oggi
up on the hillside

1680
02:15:29,850 --> 02:15:35,130
the smoke the observer and sentries both
people at the same time jumping he was

1681
02:15:35,130 --> 02:15:38,310
banging out the moonlight shadow he's
died at the corona speed but then he

1682
02:15:38,310 --> 02:15:41,670
brings the arms back down yet they still
see fly on to the observer and century

1683
02:15:41,670 --> 02:15:45,030
he gets out of range in the century
however and Xerox that probably wasn't

1684
02:15:45,030 --> 02:15:48,900
the older he went to meant to do that in
but now he's conceived fly but he

1685
02:15:48,900 --> 02:15:51,990
weren't going remember Roshan's the
target they can't expend these huge

1686
02:15:51,990 --> 02:15:59,120
abilities on anything other than eg
Harris really nice dodge from eg I think

1687
02:15:59,120 --> 02:16:02,880
honest milk got broken by the ogre I
think it was and he blinked away

1688
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:05,910
instantly and ahna tried to chase and
find something but couldn't get it so

1689
02:16:05,910 --> 02:16:10,500
not fruitful there from OG but they get
control of the area which also has value

1690
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:15,300
with Roshan oh if you want to try to get
there that quite a ways to run they have

1691
02:16:15,300 --> 02:16:19,530
the smokes ready then plenty of in fact
three of them on blind but there's so

1692
02:16:19,530 --> 02:16:22,250
much damage on anithing and again
throughout the whole eg will arrive

1693
02:16:22,250 --> 02:16:27,210
having birth mkb and the me Anya sets
helping him out by tanking it through so

1694
02:16:27,210 --> 02:16:31,200
they're both taking any damage back from
Thompson he unafraid smoke here they'll

1695
02:16:31,200 --> 02:16:34,530
get rid of the observed woman's getting
information and now he just does the

1696
02:16:34,530 --> 02:16:38,030
treetops trying almost made out some
kind of ability in the trees

1697
02:16:38,030 --> 02:16:42,750
creating space acres has picked up it is
in the hands of Anna and they'll pass

1698
02:16:42,750 --> 02:16:47,040
the cheese over to Thompson he has the
crystallis available too so this tree

1699
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:52,970
toss just this Bali asan fan over a
level right now

1700
02:16:58,139 --> 02:17:02,139
and now you've got a good really really
careful s e-g the push will be coming

1701
02:17:02,139 --> 02:17:07,479
eventually think a lot of pressure right
now is on fly shoulders hit a good slow

1702
02:17:07,480 --> 02:17:11,080
but stomp get a good splitter off they
will need every bit of damage they can

1703
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:16,091
get yep they're buying up I'm wondering
if the courier can make the tracking of

1704
02:17:16,091 --> 02:17:20,380
sumela want to spend the money he can
buy a satanic right now he can't be on
older this is very unusual build from s4

1705
02:17:22,870 --> 02:17:27,160
and he feels like if he is getting
chained stunned you can perhaps provide
like a pseudo save weight RTC by just

1706
02:17:29,500 --> 02:17:32,920
going in and stunning people are
actually any of that or is could be one

1707
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:37,960
of the few games that we don't see even
a Vlad's picked up like there's nothing
from eg and that's bad news for terribly

1708
02:17:40,360 --> 02:17:44,560
he loves have glanced in his team the
best thing is a ring of Basilius that's
that's it

1709
02:17:49,679 --> 02:17:54,929
quit prioritizing getting a solar crest
think it's a better choice than obliged

1710
02:17:54,929 --> 02:17:59,279
to you need to protect that one key guy
that gets hit in the chrono what solar

1711
02:17:59,279 --> 02:18:02,539
crest that can make the difference
between life and death

1712
02:18:02,539 --> 02:18:07,409
TP is coming to was the top just took
company brewed up here 36 and a half
minutes and crits gonna show himself

1713
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:12,599
into York is instantly gonna chill if he
feels it's real and he feels it strongly

1714
02:18:12,599 --> 02:18:16,439
the fidgets the stunt the quickly pull
way maybe there's a control neuron Anouk

1715
02:18:16,439 --> 02:18:19,439
down into the trees once again crit
trying to use the a spot in the

1716
02:18:19,439 --> 02:18:22,949
moonlight shadow he just has to wait it
out at the stop he's just out afraid to

1717
02:18:22,949 --> 02:18:26,880
cream once again he gets visible fully
because of the leap away and now tear he
gets the flag down at the end was not

1718
02:18:32,459 --> 02:18:34,169
that crit was scared he was gonna get
caught

1719
02:18:34,169 --> 02:18:39,779
jerax with the gym just needs to get in
range and they get him good read from OG

1720
02:18:39,779 --> 02:18:42,840
sending up these two heroes here
expecting that somebody will go and push

1721
02:18:42,840 --> 02:18:50,789
the lane out in the air a right ichi
just trapped in the base but now ergy

1722
02:18:50,789 --> 02:18:53,899
looking for the killer blow

1723
02:18:55,090 --> 02:19:00,880
nothing but illusions to push out the
lanes tiny trying to find trees to work
with all Anna needs to do is get that

1724
02:19:04,450 --> 02:19:08,740
nice chronosphere with Thompson on the
tree line Anna multicart is arriving
from med school and Anna star stroke

1725
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:16,210
lawyer can't really time walk off a lot
of that damage but hey SAP is there to
attend to his words the real Mercy bronc

1726
02:19:19,959 --> 02:19:27,909
game yep I agree
tips retail has been beat down here we

1727
02:19:27,910 --> 02:19:30,729
go again
long stunt on the arrow Anna members got

1728
02:19:30,728 --> 02:19:35,529
the agency model but it's the Lord
cooldown abilities fly getting smacked

1729
02:19:35,530 --> 02:19:49,810
in the that tree had missiles my back
has to arrive the mainly wreck is gonna
fall and is still waiting for the right

1730
02:19:51,490 --> 02:19:55,540
girl recipient I'm on T Z playing on the
edge lisa has done some of the damage

1731
02:19:55,540 --> 02:19:59,280
here to jump over PI over 2

1732
02:20:01,780 --> 02:20:05,811
need two-thirds of work five back to
Melbourne on TV is now or never
the Aaron hilf connect Thompson still is

1733
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:11,091
having to stand there in the middle the
et splitter and has jumped itself back

1734
02:20:11,091 --> 02:20:14,480
again but as he he he terrified top he's
there to be saved

1735
02:20:14,480 --> 02:20:17,480
they're trying to get the no first time
it's nice to know we can talk to down on

1736
02:20:17,480 --> 02:20:25,790
the hillside but he actually TV that in
front of our TV on our TVs hard they

1737
02:20:25,790 --> 02:20:29,540
didn't take the racks third the Bailey
racks drop the two hundred is now regen

1738
02:20:29,540 --> 02:20:34,040
enough but that was a really expensive
hold and to buy back their terribly gyro

1739
02:20:34,040 --> 02:20:38,421
and allure tight just to defend they
didn't even get a good fight out of it

1740
02:20:38,421 --> 02:20:47,841
the Kielty how's it like the worst trade
in the history of trade deals maybe ever

1741
02:20:47,841 --> 02:20:53,750
that's really bad someone get them a new
negotiator who do you feeling very calm

1742
02:20:53,750 --> 02:20:58,990
comfortable right now in this game and
the primary problem is that RTC actually

1743
02:20:58,990 --> 02:21:03,471
they don't have a really good front
liner right you you want somebody that

1744
02:21:03,471 --> 02:21:07,011
goes in first starts the fight so that
art easy and Sammael don't get targeted

1745
02:21:07,011 --> 02:21:11,301
but the only guy who can really do it
with is over but he's not tanky enough
to feel like he can do it if you blink

1746
02:21:12,980 --> 02:21:17,631
speak heavies goes in he's just gonna
get focused and there's the damage which

1747
02:21:17,631 --> 02:21:22,370
is creep Holly
same on the kill kill fly this one

1748
02:21:22,370 --> 02:21:27,320
almost kills s fault now he'd be
dreaming of having that plus 40 strength
he's a quarter of a level away from it

1749
02:21:28,910 --> 02:21:33,110
even then I don't know if I'll help the
damage does seem to get stronger and

1750
02:21:33,110 --> 02:21:38,271
stronger from RG Vegas will be reclaimed
but now Boyd has only conspiracy well

1751
02:21:38,271 --> 02:21:44,870
he's going for a nagging him cept to
build on the void many chrono is as they

1752
02:21:44,870 --> 02:21:48,370
can get every minute

1753
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:56,890
here we're going in yeah like it's
Poppins the way is the opening oh do you
want to go because there's no

1754
02:21:57,760 --> 02:22:01,630
metamorphosis so they feel like Yugi
can't take this fight so far they're
right they even have to save he's gonna

1755
02:22:03,310 --> 02:22:07,480
smoke up a level what do they do you
want to wrap around the back

1756
02:22:07,480 --> 02:22:10,960
Smart's already breaking on some male
sense the one on the front lines go BKB

1757
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:15,940
he knows he can just be that attractive
who wants to come in from eg the manly

1758
02:22:15,940 --> 02:22:18,520
barrack doesn't really send a chance
another sleep this one several phases

1759
02:22:18,520 --> 02:22:22,030
point or go jumping to the back boys
intially jumps back out to help his

1760
02:22:22,030 --> 02:22:25,660
teammates the BKB or Go Go is a good
distraction but eg what can they really

1761
02:22:25,660 --> 02:22:29,050
get out of it Oh : down on top of the
ramp tempers fall but here comes Anna

1762
02:22:29,050 --> 02:22:32,920
going on top of ITV where's the arm
fitting still flies going down he just

1763
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:38,430
can't take this bought the white and now
the jump in row

1764
02:22:41,820 --> 02:22:46,330
t-rex and trolling smell the back line
there's normal BKB there's normal roads

1765
02:22:46,330 --> 02:22:50,230
attacking to work with and Artie's even
stolen life does not have the son de

1766
02:22:50,230 --> 02:22:54,950
arriba killed it with a frog
this may just be it with Nunavut left

1767
02:22:54,950 --> 02:23:00,420
Jonathan doesn't have enough power
perché will not let up in something okay

1768
02:23:00,420 --> 02:23:07,860
inside your face I remember doing this
in game 2 the Snyder is slightly

1769
02:23:07,860 --> 02:23:11,850
different this time around so objectives
to take and eg still want to try and

1770
02:23:11,850 --> 02:23:17,340
fight fly jumping into the multi cuff
Anna once again saves the false promise

1771
02:23:17,340 --> 02:23:21,840
is there no cha will sacrifice himself
will even be a sacrifice to mal can't

1772
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:28,290
get the kills from Thompson he says the
tossed up and that's GJ we will have our

1773
02:23:28,290 --> 02:23:33,971
briefing of the tih
turn coming to
three a decider between RG and eg what a

1774
02:23:39,910 --> 02:23:43,240
great game from OG it looked relatively
grim at one point we were starting to

1775
02:23:43,240 --> 02:23:46,631
consider if they were going to falter in
this game but they came online with

1776
02:23:46,631 --> 02:23:49,320
their void they joined the team fights
they got a couple of really good ones

1777
02:23:49,320 --> 02:23:54,070
think in this game compared to Game one
just night and day with toxin binding

1778
02:23:54,070 --> 02:23:58,750
tons of kills in the early game keeping
or GE basically kind of even by doing

1779
02:23:58,750 --> 02:24:02,950
that they never really got far ahead
early on in the game but they it's

1780
02:24:02,950 --> 02:24:05,471
occurred that they could get to this mid
game stage that they were looking for
with their timing and boy did they hit

1781
02:24:07,421 --> 02:24:11,620
hard when they got it yeah they did and
man that's gonna hit hard for Evil

1782
02:24:11,620 --> 02:24:15,101
Geniuses
now levelled up they looked very very

1783
02:24:15,101 --> 02:24:19,511
happy at the end of Game one a lot about
Nortel even just stops for a moment

1784
02:24:19,511 --> 02:24:24,011
looking back if I come on man everybody
together unless you walk out of here I

1785
02:24:24,011 --> 02:24:27,730
feel good the biggest difference between
these two teams in this game with drop

1786
02:24:27,730 --> 02:24:31,811
there's obviously many differences but
one of the really big things oh gee with

1787
02:24:31,811 --> 02:24:37,710
the save no tail has a huge impact in
this game with this Oracle

1788
02:24:40,130 --> 02:24:51,579
[Music]
preview of last year just the other way

1789
02:24:51,579 --> 02:24:55,359
around you know but going to this sense
is always a joy to watch these two teams

1790
02:24:55,359 --> 02:24:59,409
play we're gonna break down the game a
little bit grant I wanted to start with

1791
02:24:59,409 --> 02:25:02,680
you because you know you watch the boys
play and they didn't cut it this time

1792
02:25:02,680 --> 02:25:06,220
around no they didn't there was an
insanely good draft from og as he said
right if you last pick your five it

1793
02:25:09,249 --> 02:25:13,779
better have a huge impact and it did
save after save Thompson middle played

1794
02:25:13,779 --> 02:25:17,169
an extraordinary guy ensue mailed it
both middle players were probably some

1795
02:25:17,169 --> 02:25:20,319
of the best players that game but
Thompson he ran around made a ton of

1796
02:25:20,319 --> 02:25:24,399
space our teasease life was held for
like 15 to 20 minutes he had absolutely

1797
02:25:24,399 --> 02:25:31,119
no impact it was a it was a tough game
for him for sure it looked great though

1798
02:25:31,119 --> 02:25:34,390
but what do you got what do you got for
us to deny my point introduced us what's
what do you see here that you do you

1799
02:25:35,979 --> 02:25:43,899
find worth pointing at Thompson's kDa
ratio a 13 for 15 this man participated

1800
02:25:43,899 --> 02:26:10,560
nearly in every single engagement that
last toss into the chromaspheres03 480p

1801
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:15,279
know they get placed at some point in
time you move on with your life blah

1802
02:26:15,279 --> 02:26:19,539
blah blah but Thompson always takes
advantage of these situations he sees

1803
02:26:19,539 --> 02:26:22,270
our TZ farming the jungle he wants to
make sure that this is never a

1804
02:26:22,270 --> 02:26:26,819
comfortable situation for him kills him
easy that ward you everybody gets one
can you get two with the same ward

1805
02:26:29,560 --> 02:26:34,479
let me tell you something you can as we
see here it is yet again the same Ward

1806
02:26:34,479 --> 02:26:40,149
and RTZ is yet again farming the same
area this camp this camp it's all the

1807
02:26:40,149 --> 02:26:43,810
same to Thompson he just want skills
he's gonna toss in Gerak's

1808
02:26:43,810 --> 02:26:46,419
you'd think he'd have a nagging him
scepter no it's only ten minutes into

1809
02:26:46,419 --> 02:26:51,310
the game that was just a tiny toss so
much vision control here and Thompson

1810
02:26:51,310 --> 02:26:54,279
just continues dominating the entire map
you see here Mirana

1811
02:26:54,279 --> 02:26:58,689
has nowhere left to go she can't go
north she can't go east get the tops

1812
02:26:58,689 --> 02:27:02,360
into the face
and he's still not done he's flying

1813
02:27:02,360 --> 02:27:06,320
cruising around the middle and it just
gonna keep on prowl I don't even know

1814
02:27:06,320 --> 02:27:10,280
what you would call that walk cycle from
Thompson perfect Fisher blog from chair

1815
02:27:10,280 --> 02:27:16,551
axe flies cornered like a rat down he
goes I know a lot of people talk about
farming patterns you know this yeah this

1816
02:27:20,660 --> 02:27:26,030
is more like kill patterns systematic
systematic slaughter yeah just I mean as

1817
02:27:26,030 --> 02:27:29,961
he said I the first time arteezy does
that ward you're like all right the fact
that no one went out and D warded it

1818
02:27:31,971 --> 02:27:35,061
like you had to know there's a ward
there just a little bit of a mess play

1819
02:27:35,061 --> 02:27:38,931
two deaths on a TV from one ward is very
impactful mr. Robicheau

1820
02:27:38,931 --> 02:27:43,490
yeah that was crazy actually and we
talked about will if a.g could recover

1821
02:27:43,490 --> 02:27:47,990
reset relax and go back into this second
game clean it felt like they came back

1822
02:27:47,990 --> 02:27:52,461
with a planet looked not completely
clean but definitely luckier than a 104

1823
02:27:52,461 --> 02:27:56,811
sure I I don't know if AG games are ever
really that clean they're a little bit

1824
02:27:56,811 --> 02:28:00,261
cloudy because they're willing to fight
you on any terms like as soon as they

1825
02:28:00,261 --> 02:28:03,110
hit their item timings
I feel like this team is like it's go

1826
02:28:03,110 --> 02:28:07,311
time we're just gonna engage non-stop so
sometimes it's gonna look a little bit

1827
02:28:07,311 --> 02:28:12,081
awkward like we saw but when it goes
well it goes really well yeah and I

1828
02:28:12,081 --> 02:28:15,230
think it goes back to like the team
fight right one side had a void in an

1829
02:28:15,230 --> 02:28:18,950
earth shaker the other side like what's
your biggest team but you have a TBI

1830
02:28:18,950 --> 02:28:23,391
Marana and ogre you don't have these
end-all-be-all spells so eventually if
they hit those spells

1831
02:28:24,530 --> 02:28:28,971
you're gonna lose because you got you're
all single target yep you are indeed now
we have a little bit of time before we

1832
02:28:31,791 --> 02:28:36,831
get this third game going which means I
get finally get to ask blitz the

1833
02:28:36,831 --> 02:28:42,980
question what was the story okay wait
what's right so he's been saying that he

1834
02:28:42,980 --> 02:28:46,280
had a story and we didn't have so long
we didn't have time to say go pedal

1835
02:28:46,280 --> 02:28:50,900
enough finally you know this is this is
a high building for me what is this
story alright so right yes i'll

1836
02:28:52,791 --> 02:28:56,990
birmingham this year last year last year
last year and i heard rumblings that

1837
02:28:56,990 --> 02:29:01,490
they were gonna get i didn't know about
fly but i heard about s4 that was like

1838
02:29:01,490 --> 02:29:06,081
the first thing that had happened so of
course OG did pretty terrible at the

1839
02:29:06,081 --> 02:29:10,431
tournament and I went up to Seb at the
end of the tournament and I was like

1840
02:29:10,431 --> 02:29:15,141
like I thought he knew about the kick
that's what this was about I thought he

1841
02:29:15,141 --> 02:29:20,391
knew about the kick yeah so I go up to
him and I was just like rough times man

1842
02:29:20,391 --> 02:29:26,391
and he's like it's only ESL like it's
all good man I was like what are you

1843
02:29:26,391 --> 02:29:29,210
talking about and he's just like it's
UCS else not that big of a deal and I

1844
02:29:29,210 --> 02:29:32,721
was like shit like I got a backpedal
onto this and he saw my face and he was

1845
02:29:32,721 --> 02:29:35,240
trying to figure it out
uh-huh and then he just left it alone

1846
02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:39,620
and later on he told me that's how he
knew oh stuff went down the way that it

1847
02:29:39,620 --> 02:29:45,380
went down no I wasn't trying to be I
thought I was I was like I was trying to
because I like sev he was talent too we

1848
02:29:47,391 --> 02:29:50,540
briefly for like three days made a team
together

1849
02:29:50,540 --> 02:29:55,580
it was like he was like hey I was like
I'll try to console him I was like it's
all good don't we just like why wait is

1850
02:30:03,471 --> 02:30:07,130
that the is that the only TI player
you've played with I didn't play here's

1851
02:30:07,130 --> 02:30:13,700
how it went down it was like you didn't
remember a TI he was just like hey we

1852
02:30:13,700 --> 02:30:16,550
should play together and I was like okay
and then I played like two days and I
was like I'm not good yeah I played with

1853
02:30:22,190 --> 02:30:25,851
sin too for a bit and I was like yeah
well I was like this is a bad idea I

1854
02:30:25,851 --> 02:30:30,021
shouldn't do this
and bsj in fact I played with like

1855
02:30:30,021 --> 02:30:33,170
everybody I played with two of the
people on that panel at some point I

1856
02:30:33,170 --> 02:30:38,990
play with purge and you know Febby ditch
me famously in Korea you guys were

1857

yeah it was really all right we've been

1893
02:34:11,270 --> 02:34:16,239
talking about smell and how you want his
first TI mm-hmm this is his fifth ti

1894
02:34:16,239 --> 02:34:23,000
what that can't be true it is true why
would that make grand feel hold he's 19

1895
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:29,660
yeah I don't look at day over 16 I'm
feeling great I don't know he's making

1896
02:34:29,660 --> 02:34:33,560
him feel good no it's crazy I remember
the first time I actually met sumail it

1897
02:34:33,560 --> 02:34:39,410
was a d2l the only term and I've ever
well B went to in Vegas yeah and he was

1898
02:34:39,410 --> 02:34:42,710
so young that's the famous picture with
all the Chinese players behind him

1899
02:34:42,710 --> 02:34:47,210
watching oh yeah he looked so young and
I remember that tournament it was not a

1900
02:34:47,210 --> 02:34:51,979
very good tournament and sumail he
didn't look good like honestly he was

1901
02:34:51,979 --> 02:34:55,279
Jake demographers yeah he was and it
didn't help that there was 40% packet

1902
02:34:55,279 --> 02:34:58,790
loss during the whole tournament but
like this guy he got last place he lost

1903
02:34:58,790 --> 02:35:03,199
to a team with demon standing in on it
so I was like this guy can't be the

1904
02:35:03,199 --> 02:35:06,560
future and then you know queue forward
six months he's winning a TI and what do
you know

1905
02:35:06,949 --> 02:35:10,810
didn't Iggy produce that tournament

1906
02:35:15,100 --> 02:35:20,120
there were some affiliation
strong affiliation Conrad was like the

1907
02:35:20,120 --> 02:35:24,290
guy who ran production well it was just
a trial tournament to get some meal

1908
02:35:24,290 --> 02:35:30,470
comfortable with playing and it worked
because after that they they went to DAC
2015 they went to China they went to

1909
02:35:33,350 --> 02:35:36,979
Shanghai and they crushed it they went
on a storm I was like that was a G's
best story I see what you did there I

1910
02:35:38,899 --> 02:35:43,580
get it I get it yeah
what a journey that has been it's been

1911
02:35:43,580 --> 02:35:46,729
it's been actually crazy that Agios
always has been

1912
02:35:46,729 --> 02:35:51,079
I'm very high at the top and a lot of
internationals and right now I mean even

1913
02:35:51,079 --> 02:35:56,539
if they don't win the next game they're
still top six right yes you're still

1914
02:35:56,539 --> 02:35:59,869
really good and I'm assuming that
they're I don't think either teams okay

1915
02:35:59,869 --> 02:36:03,800
with that all right if you ask Oh G or
eg are you okay with the top six they're
gonna be like now it's a win or nothing

1916
02:36:05,720 --> 02:36:10,249
it's a winner we don't give a shit kind
of thing whoa oh you tell me you know

1917
02:36:10,249 --> 02:36:15,529
we're about to see these players take
this stage for the third time in this

1918
02:36:15,529 --> 02:36:41,930
series do they look like they will be
okay they both look confident right like

1919
02:36:41,930 --> 02:36:46,189
neither teams coming up kind of sad you
see sumail leading the way smiling no

1920
02:36:46,189 --> 02:36:49,729
tail on the other side doing the exact
same thing we're just ready for some
good dota we really really are now we

1921
02:36:53,060 --> 02:36:58,369
know that you know the the the best
thing to deal with og is Bala dial in

1922
02:36:58,369 --> 02:37:01,880
the Mac we've seen og do that or sorry
eg do that both times around I'm
assuming it's gonna be happening again I

1923
02:37:03,350 --> 02:37:09,470
am curious to find out what Mae's these
two teams even if they don't have the IO
and the mag what makes you two steams be

1924
02:37:11,149 --> 02:37:16,550
such a good match for each other because
they do tend to push each other to the

1925
02:37:16,550 --> 02:37:23,810
limits I think it's they they have like
a similar way of playing and I don't

1926
02:37:23,810 --> 02:37:27,439
mean like in terms like early late-game
I think it it comes on like the the item

1927
02:37:27,439 --> 02:37:31,760
timings it's when RTZ and Anna say like
we're both ready to fight at this point

1928
02:37:31,760 --> 02:37:36,770
so and they're willing to push each
other at different points like and also

1929
02:37:36,770 --> 02:37:39,800
they're really highly skilled too so it
just sort of leads like a nice chess
match where one team wants the game to

1930
02:37:41,539 --> 02:37:47,180
go and end at one one point and
conversely it's true - like if you see

1931
02:37:47,180 --> 02:37:51,800
how they play void for example and like
how he rotates he wants to hit his item
timing first he wants like one kill item

1932
02:37:53,569 --> 02:37:57,529
same with Thompson and that's like
generally how they move around and eg

1933
02:37:57,529 --> 02:38:00,229
sort of similar they're just a little
bit slower pace yeah
in that way I think it's always rtz

1934
02:38:02,210 --> 02:38:06,710
wants that second item yeah cuz he went
like first item BKB right he went like

1935
02:38:06,710 --> 02:38:10,999
Yasha BKB this game I believe yeah and I
think it's because he realized the key

1936
02:38:10,999 --> 02:38:13,909
probably had a fight a little bit
earlier than he would have liked yeah I

1937
02:38:13,909 --> 02:38:16,999
like how they just push each other and
press like the rivalry aspect of it I

1938
02:38:16,999 --> 02:38:20,210
think always just makes the game a
little bit more hype yeah it does

1939
02:38:20,210 --> 02:38:23,119
they're never just gonna go down like
sure game one was stomp but that's

1940
02:38:23,119 --> 02:38:26,180
exactly why it comes back to Game two
it's never gonna be a straight up 2-0

1941
02:38:26,180 --> 02:38:29,600
stop no matter what people think no
matter who's the best team in the world

1942
02:38:29,600 --> 02:38:34,399
like they're always gonna push each
other and you know you know we like a
good story and we like it when there's

1943
02:38:36,140 --> 02:38:40,550
you know a little bit spice in there too
and often the players like you know what

1944
02:38:40,550 --> 02:38:48,079
I don't care who I play I just want to
win this time we know they care they all

1945
02:38:48,079 --> 02:38:53,180
change their their profile pictures on
scenes again place the banners to no

1946
02:38:53,180 --> 02:38:57,260
tails face when the handshake happened
which by the way there will be a

1947
02:38:57,260 --> 02:39:00,439
handshake who we don't know which one
yet but there will be a handshake after

1948
02:39:00,439 --> 02:39:05,720
the next game I mean they I personally
love the drama I mean to be fair that
was some of the times you said that even

1949
02:39:08,210 --> 02:39:12,859
other players want to do it for the
memes they play it up because they they

1950
02:39:12,859 --> 02:39:18,109
find it humorous as well yeah almost the
shipping culture that happens whenever

1951
02:39:18,109 --> 02:39:21,199
these rivalries are formed yeah but Tim
oh man said that if for whatever reason

1952
02:39:21,199 --> 02:39:25,249
like his dream was to play against
liquid in the lower bracket and if he

1953
02:39:25,249 --> 02:39:29,229
knocked him out he was gonna do like a
fake angry handshake when he walked past

1954
02:39:29,229 --> 02:39:38,029
he was expecting to be knocked out yeah
I think I mean obviously sugar this let

1955
02:39:38,029 --> 02:39:43,460
me just say the expectations were they
were you know they were as is I mean
that being said I I do hope that people

1956
02:39:46,789 --> 02:39:52,909
can like separate the the entertainment
aspect versus the actual drama aspect
because you know obviously we like

1957
02:39:54,439 --> 02:39:57,380
talking about this kind of stuff I don't
know what flies thing yeah I don't know
what no-till is thinking these people

1958
02:39:58,819 --> 02:40:02,350
are real people with real families real
lives and that kind of stuff and so I

1959
02:40:02,350 --> 02:40:08,329
think it's important that viewers and us
can kind of separate the concept of you

1960
02:40:08,329 --> 02:40:11,449
know what happens here whenever the
cameras go off on that the gee-gees are

1961
02:40:11,449 --> 02:40:13,829
called these people continue leading
their lives

1962
02:40:13,829 --> 02:40:18,029
don't necessarily like push your drama I
can assure you after all that happen

1963
02:40:18,029 --> 02:40:21,420
though it was it was real be yeah
there's no fake drama but it's been a

1964
02:40:21,420 --> 02:40:27,149
year yeah it has been but how do you
feel about that you know you just saw OG

1965
02:40:27,149 --> 02:40:30,630
the team was pretty much is making fun
you the whole year you know go and win

1966
02:40:30,630 --> 02:40:34,890
that ti like a year later you're here
again I feel like the same feelings

1967
02:40:34,890 --> 02:40:38,100
they're definitely coming back up again
yeah I feel like that is true for a lot

1968
02:40:38,100 --> 02:40:41,550
of people the point you made so now I
mean it's true like for example if you
look at Kara one puppy you know they are

1969
02:40:43,199 --> 02:40:46,880
the eiffel's and exactly like to play
that up but in reality you know they are
respecting of each other and they're

1970
02:40:48,720 --> 02:40:52,140
both happy at the place they're at now
as we saw in an interview earlier today

1971
02:40:52,140 --> 02:41:04,170
didn't curl same interview are we free
that was a joke I was at the wedding I'm

1972
02:41:04,170 --> 02:41:10,770
still alive okay so it was good oh thank
you for confirming you know nervous it's

1973
02:41:10,770 --> 02:41:17,880
all good no I think that this is some
drama that I call it drama some friction
that is definitely need resolution yeah

1974
02:41:21,300 --> 02:41:26,699
not the player this is true you know we
know we need some some dota 2 to be

1975
02:41:26,699 --> 02:41:32,130
played we need a game theory for that we
need a drive we need some heroes chosen
so let's go to that draft game free

1976
02:41:53,080 --> 02:42:04,180
[Music]
weights gonna go though what do you guys

1977
02:42:04,180 --> 02:42:06,700
think
doctor sure but it's looking like in

1978
02:42:06,700 --> 02:42:09,730
chanters there's a pretty hot one that's
gonna be contestant it might be deciding
quite a bit here in this matchup as we

1979
02:42:11,350 --> 02:42:14,920
saw lanes we're really important in that
last game of course also the big team

1980
02:42:14,920 --> 02:42:18,190
fights but does feel like enchantress
seems to just like set you up to have

1981
02:42:18,190 --> 02:42:21,310
that like great advantage going out of
coming out of the laning phase
enchantress it is enchantress but I just

1982
02:42:24,250 --> 02:42:28,690
I just realize like the mid mid lane is
so important I think both games whoever

1983
02:42:28,690 --> 02:42:33,850
won mid just had a cattle game on their
bags like Thompson or super hyper

1984
02:42:33,850 --> 02:42:39,460
aggressive mid player who you know if
the advantage is given or as I say that
picking changes again so almost exactly

1985
02:42:42,460 --> 02:42:45,040
the same fans the only difference is
elder Titan was in the first phase

1986
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:48,460
instead of ancient apparition similar to
the first named draft is that a pick
order is flipped as well mm-hmm so as I

1987
02:42:51,190 --> 02:42:55,360
was saying I think like this Thompson
this sooner these two players just love

1988
02:42:55,360 --> 02:42:59,050
to kill heroes and if they're given the
advantage they're just gonna go for
blood so I think the mid master is

1989
02:43:01,390 --> 02:43:05,590
really important between these two teams
yeah I want to see in particular at

1990
02:43:05,590 --> 02:43:08,110
least for og I want to see them playing
something just run around and make kills

1991
02:43:08,110 --> 02:43:11,380
happen without The Monkey King or the
tiny eg they're gonna deny that they're
gonna take the tiny away this time

1992
02:43:13,180 --> 02:43:17,200
around I feel like one of the strengths
that Thompson has is the players his

1993
02:43:17,200 --> 02:43:22,090
ability to just like go insane he makes
your opponents look like pub opponents

1994
02:43:22,090 --> 02:43:25,960
is what it seems like um and he was able
to do that last game he got three kills
like tsunami showed within a matter of

1995
02:43:27,640 --> 02:43:32,021
one minute it was insane to watch can't
he do that again without timing like

1996
02:43:32,021 --> 02:43:35,650
what's the hero substitute that would
solve that I twice how does he do it
Monkey King is definitely one of those

1997
02:43:36,970 --> 02:43:41,021
heroes that he does it with but can you
beat a tiny enlightenment Bucky King I

1998
02:43:41,021 --> 02:43:44,530
guess he has no armor a level one it
could work they used to I used to see

1999
02:43:44,530 --> 02:43:47,560
the matchup actually a lot last year and
it was like pretty back and forth I
think the Monkey King won most of those

2000
02:43:48,640 --> 02:43:52,960
though okay but it's also the mid game
is like concerning too because you can

2001
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:57,460
also just get burst down and there's a
roaming marala and there's animal ala

2002
02:43:57,460 --> 02:44:02,410
tossed into an arrow it can be very
devastating yeah is this gonna be tops

2003
02:44:02,410 --> 02:44:07,080
invoker get this price flex pick right I
think it in so BGR X is zero for sure

2004
02:44:07,080 --> 02:44:11,250
I think you leave it open until you see
what Lane you're against for sure in the

2005
02:44:11,250 --> 02:44:16,350
mid lane and I think when you have the
Enchantress it allows you the luxury

2006
02:44:16,350 --> 02:44:19,050
about you being able to go for a little
bit more of a greedy for position
because generous just isn't generous has

2007
02:44:21,479 --> 02:44:24,359
a pretty good lane so you can put a
weaker hero with her and then it'll

2008
02:44:24,359 --> 02:44:28,260
transition in the late game well in the
laning stage won't be terrible right

2009
02:44:28,260 --> 02:44:33,359
yeah and like enchantress like I talked
about game to eat some AoE teamfight

2010
02:44:33,359 --> 02:44:40,890
control and he will provide that yep
yeah can be opposition 14ab and they st
finally wasn't being fanned out in the

2011
02:44:42,569 --> 02:44:45,149
last two games but this time i guess
because they do have that Marana and

2012
02:44:45,149 --> 02:44:49,080
they're not maybe wanting to have a save
this time around cuz last time right

2013
02:44:49,080 --> 02:44:53,270
they saved that Oracle for last pick to
save versus the combo yeah that's right

2014
02:44:53,270 --> 02:44:58,380
faceless void was integral for OG in the
late game in the mid game yeah uh he ate
a lot of arrows may be a good thing but

2015
02:45:00,380 --> 02:45:03,510
yeah I'm not gonna have that this game
supposed to be a lot harder for OG to

2016
02:45:03,510 --> 02:45:08,280
set up guaranteed teamfight once later
on yeah boy and invoker is such a

2017
02:45:08,280 --> 02:45:14,040
devastating combo together at all
we chrono and Cataclysm the League games

2018
02:45:14,040 --> 02:45:18,630
pretty devastating so I think they're
just taking it that out I love seeing
you know ti so great cuz you always like

2019
02:45:20,250 --> 02:45:23,399
do the full circle back to like either
super carries getting picked up like

2020
02:45:23,399 --> 02:45:26,700
anti mage or it's just like these
massive teamfight lineups that just

2021
02:45:26,700 --> 02:45:29,220
constantly are battling like you were
mentioning in the last game where we had
fifty something kills in the 40 minute

2022
02:45:31,080 --> 02:45:33,930
mark or even more than that something
like that it's just non-stop aggression

2023
02:45:33,930 --> 02:45:36,930
non-stop fighting non-stop trying to
take these battles and usually the team

2024
02:45:36,930 --> 02:45:40,530
with the better team fight at the ti
main stage ends up having an easier time

2025
02:45:40,530 --> 02:45:43,560
at least and executing it just really
helps if you have a hero that can grasp
win like you know where they are you see

2026
02:45:45,630 --> 02:45:49,050
them you can jump in hard disable them
guarantee kills that makes a huge

2027
02:45:49,050 --> 02:45:52,410
difference really hope the against the
terrorblade especially once you Chronos

2028
02:45:52,410 --> 02:45:55,979
for him you're like okay if you don't
have a safe you're dead period it makes

2029
02:45:55,979 --> 02:45:58,859
the game a lot easier especially for
these used to I think

2030
02:45:58,859 --> 02:46:02,700
eg og compared to like these Chinese
seems they really love to fight early

2031
02:46:02,700 --> 02:46:06,620
and just like spill a lot of blood

2032
02:46:08,500 --> 02:46:13,730
well we'll see if they could do the same
thing sent or banned now mobile hero

2033
02:46:13,730 --> 02:46:18,860
burst damage has pretty good time
getting his team on top of the enemy

2034
02:46:18,860 --> 02:46:23,600
team so maybe they're worried about the
carry for softlight matchup what do you

2035
02:46:23,600 --> 02:46:32,240
guys think it can be a setup for the
marala arrow later on and it's you're

2036
02:46:32,240 --> 02:46:38,210
stanking or centaur and EG doesn't have
ET this time around so the entire band

2037
02:46:38,210 --> 02:46:41,690
does make a little sense
so you think syncing is not as bad now

2038
02:46:41,690 --> 02:46:47,030
because the ET is not there yeah it's
definitely worse first thanking me

2039
02:46:47,030 --> 02:46:51,650
Ronaldo to combo yes the damage is
therapod it's to like one dimension or
no damage like it's bad against bkb's

2040
02:46:54,440 --> 02:47:00,340
it's gonna fall off eventually cause the
damage is linear it doesn't scale we're

2041
02:47:00,340 --> 02:47:04,550
hangover the CM that they used in the
first game I think this is also just

2042
02:47:04,550 --> 02:47:07,010
dictum that they want to play really
aggressive but they did with the CM last

2043
02:47:07,010 --> 02:47:10,850
time it allows everyone to just be
constantly on the map more you always

2044
02:47:10,850 --> 02:47:13,160
have that aura you can always keep
pushing on lanes you can always keep

2045
02:47:13,160 --> 02:47:16,100
playing aggressive and you can even have
threatened an aggro trilane as we saw

2046
02:47:16,100 --> 02:47:19,670
them do with that CM in the first series
in the first game it's a good form of

2047
02:47:19,670 --> 02:47:23,480
damage from position 5 towards the
enchantress - yeah that's a good point

2048
02:47:23,480 --> 02:47:26,630
of freezing field our ultimate was
really useful in a lot of cases against

2049
02:47:26,630 --> 02:47:29,320
the PA as well

2050
02:47:29,810 --> 02:47:33,920
so let's seal it looks at a pretty
decent hero for OG here yeah I believe I

2051
02:47:33,920 --> 02:47:38,270
got Ben's second phase in the first game
in his similar situation feels good vs

2052
02:47:38,270 --> 02:47:41,840
all these just like high magic damage
tiny is show you up high armor but very

2053
02:47:41,840 --> 02:47:45,560
high HP hero that life sitter really
enjoys playing verse yeah the only time

2054
02:47:45,560 --> 02:47:49,130
it's good versus timer for tiny just
when he gets his Ikes and you can do

2055
02:47:49,130 --> 02:47:54,590
like range heavy physical damage maybe a
carry that could be a carry that og

2056
02:47:54,590 --> 02:47:56,810
could be looking at here but I don't
know if they'll thicken in the third

2057
02:47:56,810 --> 02:48:01,130
they might save it I mean technically
they could have zero supports on the

2058
02:48:01,130 --> 02:48:05,780
board right now a little bit abnormal Oh
true anything else really good over is

2059
02:48:05,780 --> 02:48:08,750
still the pool Tohono looks okay fools
yes sir

2060
02:48:08,750 --> 02:48:14,840
what's your gel or not okay yeah similar
it's the life still here oh okay no with

2061
02:48:14,840 --> 02:48:18,470
this Ruby pick it seems like it's on in
Hooper mid right yeah that's what you

2062
02:48:18,470 --> 02:48:23,390
think this is actually cool we saw now
what the LGD series they I've been

2063
02:48:23,390 --> 02:48:26,180
seeing a lot of teams actually picking
the rubic versus the Marana now just cuz

2064
02:48:26,180 --> 02:48:29,390
you're likely to get a pretty damn good
steal like everything is good leap is

2065
02:48:29,390 --> 02:48:32,570
probably like your worst one and it's
it's a triple away to either get in or

2066
02:48:32,570 --> 02:48:35,750
get out as it Rubik which isn't bad to
have arrows a great spell because you're

2067
02:48:35,750 --> 02:48:38,990
gonna get the extra duration star storm
as well you get the amplification I've

2068
02:48:38,990 --> 02:48:41,720
really actually been liking that Rubick
pick a lot that I've been seeing from

2069
02:48:41,720 --> 02:48:44,060
teams today versus that moron in
particular

2070
02:48:44,060 --> 02:48:48,200
yeah it's against CM too which is
another it feels really great they are

2071
02:48:48,200 --> 02:48:52,820
weak against the end all our Spurs are
pretty nice and you kind of can ôt
against mu because Rubik or t Rubik emot

2072
02:48:55,610 --> 02:48:59,660
is so much stronger than your og yeah
and even if he's done somebody else you

2073
02:48:59,660 --> 02:49:04,160
can still possibly throw them into her
yeah interrupts her ultimate so i don't

2074
02:49:04,160 --> 02:49:07,490
know it was a it was a really good Rubik
pick but I'm kind of afraid for this in

2075
02:49:07,490 --> 02:49:13,490
booper scheme like we saw in the game
one tour I felt like eg marala can roam

2076
02:49:13,490 --> 02:49:18,260
to mid beam wire like Ruby cannot kind
of room to me to kill the tiny and tiny

2077
02:49:18,260 --> 02:49:22,940
versus invoker matchup in general tiny
seems to have the operation and we don't

2078
02:49:22,940 --> 02:49:27,740
even know if it's aw I guess it's a tiny
mid like it should be all grown up for

2079
02:49:27,740 --> 02:49:31,250
tiny mini yeah that's what we I mean
that's probably more than likely yeah

2080
02:49:31,250 --> 02:49:35,240
you know sumail loves to play tiny as
well as we we saw last year of course we

2081
02:49:35,240 --> 02:49:38,090
have a thirtysomething kills or whatever
when he branded the whole game it's like

2082
02:49:38,090 --> 02:49:42,380
literally this match and this part of
the bracket a year ago it's the same
the all-time kill record for a single

2083
02:49:44,359 --> 02:49:49,130
game got 30 kills it was an insane match
and then sumail still lost the match
that was versus og - right that was the

2084
02:49:51,500 --> 02:49:55,970
one that was the damage mitigation draft
where they expect her IO centaur and I

2085
02:49:55,970 --> 02:49:59,300
remember he's just running around and he
tossed our TZ into the tier 4s of course

2086
02:49:59,300 --> 02:50:03,109
that happened to that game hey man you
got 30 kills I do not care

2087
02:50:03,109 --> 02:50:07,250
you cannot say that one was two males
for messes up once let's ask vsj about

2088
02:50:07,250 --> 02:50:11,420
that you know claims to male entirely
for that game really this pics kind of

2089
02:50:11,420 --> 02:50:16,580
throwing me off buzz GG crit crit on
dark willow is one of his favorite

2090
02:50:16,580 --> 02:50:20,800
heroes he's amazing at that at that here
or - yeah wait a minute what about a

2091
02:50:20,800 --> 02:50:25,010
three Mehran I mean really brought a
could hypothetically Lane in any

2092
02:50:25,010 --> 02:50:29,149
situation that's true I guess the yeah
they could still do that three Morana

2093
02:50:29,149 --> 02:50:33,619
and then having this but three Marana
little willow that seems to squishes so

2094
02:50:33,619 --> 02:50:36,710
i think it's a bit muralha and tiny off
me
okay that makes more sense that makes

2095
02:50:38,810 --> 02:50:43,279
more sense yeah is it that squishy
versus ribbit I mean will looking get to

2096
02:50:43,279 --> 02:50:47,199
you get cursed crown toss out of the guy
that's an arrow for sure

2097
02:50:47,199 --> 02:50:54,560
Plus bramble mace follow-up maybe kill
potential and crits dark willows
excellent yeah

2098
02:50:55,850 --> 02:50:59,569
and dark will has tons of magic damage
and so she's going to be able to kill

2099
02:50:59,569 --> 02:51:02,840
the Enchantress you're gonna rush the
spirit vessel it kind of fits a lot of

2100
02:51:02,840 --> 02:51:05,659
boxes the only thing that's weird about
it is it's gonna force mirana into a

2101
02:51:05,659 --> 02:51:10,609
weird role potentially not a
non-standard for the current meta and

2102
02:51:10,609 --> 02:51:14,390
you're gonna go for that jug now
especially versus the whale oh yeah it's
so good versus that hero nice to do was

2103
02:51:16,399 --> 02:51:19,640
on option 2 I think I think what we
struck better

2104
02:51:19,640 --> 02:51:24,560
I think woody there the healing words
they can just keep on though there's two

2105
02:51:24,560 --> 02:51:29,479
years though in nature's enchantress is
here and Joe not healing healing work so

2106
02:51:29,479 --> 02:51:35,779
they can just be keep being on the map
so I think the jog is better versus the

2107
02:51:35,779 --> 02:51:38,479
willow overall because you can actually
do something when she's inside of her
realm you can actually spin and do some

2108
02:51:40,310 --> 02:51:45,130
damage as well that's it small but it's
it's something

2109
02:51:46,090 --> 02:51:51,200
all right last phase advance er Oracle
band out once again they're anticipating

2110
02:51:51,200 --> 02:51:59,590
the save hero any other save heroes do
they need a Savior Oh with the jug carry

2111
02:51:59,590 --> 02:52:04,010
we kind of protect himself there's no
BKB piercing disables on eg at all right

2112
02:52:04,010 --> 02:52:07,880
now so that spin is gonna be really
useful for himself to protect them
now one thing easy is actually really

2113
02:52:09,260 --> 02:52:12,500
missing this game unlike what the head
last game was they don't have a setups

2114
02:52:12,500 --> 02:52:16,431
done other than tiny so it's gonna be
really difficult from Rana to get arrows

2115
02:52:16,431 --> 02:52:20,780
unless it's like dark willow basically I
said delayed stun so frostbite I mean

2116
02:52:20,780 --> 02:52:23,420
it's not amazing and it doesn't give you
come out like laning phase really but

2117
02:52:23,420 --> 02:52:28,280
right yeah it's not an easier
complication yes it's but when bkb's

2118
02:52:28,280 --> 02:52:32,000
come out fro cheat then they will have
defensive options against eg sprint car

2119
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:35,690
they go for sinkings that's their that's
their five position enchantress then

2120
02:52:35,690 --> 02:52:41,150
right yeah that's the no telling
generous so very weirdly but I always

2121
02:52:41,150 --> 02:52:44,990
see no tiara putting it off the
enchantress into tolerantly job usually

2122
02:52:44,990 --> 02:52:48,500
chocolate was some disabled from
position five so they have that nice

2123
02:52:48,500 --> 02:52:54,021
disable into combo but let's see how
those her first is song yeah he can also

2124
02:52:54,021 --> 02:52:57,500
the so here's also the dispels well
versus the willow that can be kind of

2125
02:52:57,500 --> 02:53:03,110
nice to actually might or might sorry
other way around yeah just kidding it's

2126
02:53:03,110 --> 02:53:07,250
okay we all make it sighs it's a long
it's been a long day your mistake was a

2127
02:53:07,250 --> 02:53:12,620
way less egregious in - Oh a lot of I
said what am I saying

2128
02:53:12,620 --> 02:53:17,150
well we're all weird oh well what is the
carry hero DITA for eg here I know
that's that's a question you're supposed

2129
02:53:18,380 --> 02:53:22,641
to maybe it's lark
I can see start being okay arteezy's

2130
02:53:22,641 --> 02:53:26,720
fart-o
is what we said right the anti-mage's

2131
02:53:26,720 --> 02:53:30,230
they say CH they trickle back into the
TI meta and he's burst is that

2132
02:53:30,230 --> 02:53:34,040
potentially what the core I mean not
potentially but the core invoker so high

2133
02:53:34,040 --> 02:53:37,601
mana pool but I don't think it's a
little soon as your whiskey

2134
02:53:37,601 --> 02:53:41,630
why do you think they went for it Joe
was pretty good against the enemies yeah
I think they went for it because it's

2135
02:53:43,970 --> 02:53:48,989
really great organs sank in the room
like please lane wise it'll be easy lien

2136
02:53:48,989 --> 02:53:52,709
wise and game wise lane wise I'm not so
sure like he's you might have a tougher

2137
02:53:52,709 --> 02:53:57,509
time but I know like in game it's gonna
be pretty easy but Jonah is pretty good

2138
02:53:57,509 --> 02:54:01,619
against the enemies all right guys
that's the final draft here for this

2139
02:54:01,619 --> 02:54:05,369
last upper bracket match we've got a
really good game ahead of us let's toss

2140
02:54:05,369 --> 02:54:13,439
it over to Toby and send it is game 3
it's the decider but who this time

2141
02:54:13,439 --> 02:54:18,869
around we'll take the 2-1 and that
winner's bracket position urging eg

2142
02:54:18,869 --> 02:54:21,629
interesting drums once again it was
always interesting when you've been out

2143
02:54:21,629 --> 02:54:25,739
of Magna tire but yeah you love a nice
little switch up from og as far as the
lane rolls go

2144
02:54:26,519 --> 02:54:29,549
yep they gave away the Enchantress again
and as the panel was talking about this

2145
02:54:29,549 --> 02:54:32,069
enchantress wait they pick sand King
because enchantress has got to be
support now and that's why they picked

2146
02:54:33,719 --> 02:54:38,459
the antimage this is the worst match I I
love playing sinking so my favorite

2147
02:54:38,459 --> 02:54:42,749
offliners I hate playing a stance mage
it is so bad of a Lane matchup and
that's a big part of the reason eg

2148
02:54:44,309 --> 02:54:47,249
picked it here is to force that matchup
as well as it being good against the

2149
02:54:47,249 --> 02:54:51,209
invoker in the game however og you step
it up a notch they're like ok we need to

2150
02:54:51,209 --> 02:54:53,939
solve this you saw them in the booth
they were doing their math yeah and

2151
02:54:53,939 --> 02:54:57,659
they've decided that they will put the
sank in position 4 and no tail is

2152
02:54:57,659 --> 02:55:01,889
playing 5 Rubik that's how important it
is for them to solve this problem it was

2153
02:55:01,889 --> 02:55:06,209
kind of a checkmate situation almost but
they got out of it and now it's just a

2154
02:55:06,209 --> 02:55:09,539
matter of can they salvage the lanes can
this work with this support duo it's

2155
02:55:09,539 --> 02:55:13,979
very unusual the panel was already
saying like somehow Naruto makes the
support and chanters work as well yep

2156
02:55:15,809 --> 02:55:20,429
now making the support Rubick work how
do you try and lane this up them to make

2157
02:55:20,429 --> 02:55:24,421
it to make it actually happen we've seen
said to his work t-rex

2158
02:55:24,421 --> 02:55:30,450
in my man amazing in Game two on that
yes he the same team team stunner

2159
02:55:30,450 --> 02:55:35,490
teamfight role that og really need from
him as well but how do you still ensure
that Naruto has a good game on this five

2160
02:55:37,110 --> 02:55:41,221
Rubik well fortunately for him he's
laning with a strong carry in Lane
juggernaut it's a pretty good laner and

2161
02:55:42,751 --> 02:55:48,480
there's no matchup in this that he
totally can't deal with so right like

2162
02:55:48,480 --> 02:55:53,280
Ruby can jug it on together is spin and
until I could easiest grab its old but

2163
02:55:53,280 --> 02:55:58,530
yes it work but the problem with that is
Rubik deals so little damage that's the

2164
02:55:58,530 --> 02:56:01,081
problem with that combo in the start
when we're big hits level three and has

2165
02:56:01,081 --> 02:56:04,381
two in fate bolt sure but if you compare
it to something like lit juggler or

2166
02:56:04,381 --> 02:56:07,860
crystal maple jugger there's just way
more in the way of damage from those two

2167
02:56:07,860 --> 02:56:12,051
supports in the lane so it's it's
definitely a weaker version but I
honestly I just love it from og that

2168
02:56:14,341 --> 02:56:17,881
they're doing this because I think it's
a very creative and poly ideal solution
to the problem that they have to support

2169
02:56:28,200 --> 02:56:31,711
saying he also hates facing animation so
you still need to get the lanes right
and go from there and it looks like eg

2170
02:56:33,900 --> 02:56:38,940
might have the right read in this game
they put their tiny top so far and

2171
02:56:38,940 --> 02:56:41,910
anybody's down on the bottom lane with
flying yeah if they want the ends mates

2172
02:56:41,910 --> 02:56:45,091
to avoid the end so that will mean
answer mates will not play against

2173
02:56:45,091 --> 02:56:50,610
thinking so there's a bit of a win for
both teams in that sense but antimage

2174
02:56:50,610 --> 02:56:54,871
will also be a bit that was nice from
fly right underneath the juggernaut
crabs their incest three for one at the

2175
02:56:57,240 --> 02:57:04,230
very beginning this Agra trial in from
eg is very unorthodox by the way crystal

2176
02:57:04,230 --> 02:57:09,211
made dark willow antimage agro trialing
it's like you go for the Nova then they

2177
02:57:09,211 --> 02:57:13,351
have to navigate the bramble at slow
speed hey this can't last for long

2178
02:57:13,351 --> 02:57:18,079
cannon
well it's kind of reduce for Alana she

2179
02:57:18,079 --> 02:57:21,380
stood against this plane but no tell
could have a very hard time and the

2180
02:57:21,380 --> 02:57:25,069
question is how much farm he's going to
get all that's a really good damage in

2181
02:57:25,069 --> 02:57:28,760
town already actually they're playing
without a healing cell meanwhile bottom

2182
02:57:28,760 --> 02:57:32,810
line yeah I don't mean they go ham some
males taking a lot of damage as force

2183
02:57:32,810 --> 02:57:37,189
having a hard time walking away from G
Rex on the top might observe war dungeon

2184
02:57:37,189 --> 02:57:41,569
like on the other side the trees so they
were able to see us for any support that

2185
02:57:41,569 --> 02:57:46,010
comes his way i faintly love salt supply
they got three free hits in an honor

2186
02:57:46,010 --> 02:57:49,819
just burning off the mana as fast as
possible so anna has to dig into the

2187
02:57:49,819 --> 02:57:53,869
mango to spend later and then that's a
that's a great grab some serious damage

2188
02:57:53,869 --> 02:58:03,319
he gonna spit he refused to skill spin
because he feels like he needs healing
or to sustain and he's still a chief

2189
02:58:06,859 --> 02:58:10,069
he's backed out he still hasn't put in
his skill point and has to fought any

2190
02:58:10,069 --> 02:58:15,380
extra region there's no Sal still coming
in no-till had the gold for it honestly

2191
02:58:15,380 --> 02:58:19,329
surprised that they didn't drop some
region and and bring that with honesty P

2192
02:58:19,329 --> 02:58:24,050
and now look that he had the advantage
but in flying to the top lane 8 foot

2193
02:58:24,050 --> 02:58:27,130
three against one zero that's a try
executed in the start

2194
02:58:27,130 --> 02:58:31,870
man the jump came in Thompson and smell
what a surprise killing each other under

2195
02:58:31,870 --> 02:58:36,010
the t1 tower they bogus to kill sir
he'll get the XP yeah big winner there's

2196
02:58:36,010 --> 02:58:40,750
some eel he got more gold and he got the
experience so he's gonna feel good about

2197
02:58:40,750 --> 02:58:44,560
that one cuz that's just the way to
middling gets to work when it's at 1:1

2198
02:58:44,560 --> 02:58:50,680
traders sometimes the guy who gets the
kill second is not as unfavorite as

2199
02:58:50,680 --> 02:58:56,170
Thompson was net exchange but especially
hilarious how they start again

2200
02:58:56,170 --> 02:59:00,010
Thompson's back under the t1 tower
meeting into samayal they both have to

2201
02:59:00,010 --> 02:59:04,060
start munching on tankers and dropping
down a halflife bottom lane that's easy

2202
02:59:04,060 --> 02:59:09,100
he's going on us again on Anna Anna
still holding the spinners arteezy drops

2203
02:59:09,100 --> 02:59:13,000
lower they just want to get some
experience into them well as for and she

2204
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:16,030
ended up buying jeering sometime to
attack you know he's body blocking s4

2205
02:59:16,030 --> 02:59:19,570
gonna buy more time for set to get
damaged in but as Paul would just sound
this off

2206
02:59:20,760 --> 02:59:25,689
in the meantime bottom lane they're out
of region Oh G completely dry actually

2207
02:59:25,689 --> 02:59:31,390
nevermind honor go to tango pack left
but no selves still no region no mana no

2208
02:59:31,390 --> 02:59:37,450
tail thanks working with us easy you
brought up the matter and this is easy

2209
02:59:37,450 --> 02:59:42,850
harassment for range would you notice
the top lane is going well SAP has great

2210
02:59:42,850 --> 02:59:46,660
farm they're shutting down the tiny
nicely as they should be with the head

2211
02:59:46,660 --> 02:59:50,170
start they had but the other two lanes
going oh fuck you Gian this time around

2212
02:59:50,170 --> 02:59:53,560
our TZ is not getting shut down and the
way they've been playing the series so

2213
02:59:53,560 --> 02:59:57,340
far I think you can consider this an
early lead for them that is what they

2214
02:59:57,340 --> 03:00:00,790
want an teammates to have a beginning
that he can he can work with is that a

2215
03:00:00,790 --> 03:00:05,500
feeling that's a ring a health layout no
it's a great fans and sorrow region for

2216
03:00:05,500 --> 03:00:11,479
rtz
so we can keep on the pressure just love

2217
03:00:11,479 --> 03:00:15,080
it even the faultless news I think that
was actually so uh the tree Telstra miss

2218
03:00:15,080 --> 03:00:18,170
fall wouldn't get the kill on the range
of rape on tall plane they're really

2219
03:00:18,170 --> 03:00:21,350
just trying to keep him down as much as
possible and they have easy he said he's

2220
03:00:21,350 --> 03:00:25,729
five to zero the lanes looking good but
bottom plate it's easy just gets more
and more time to beat into it and now

2221
03:00:27,770 --> 03:00:31,729
another ruling fall from on TV third
tell navigating the brambles he'll get
the space but he will not escape print

2222
03:00:33,949 --> 03:00:37,550
and it was trying to sit on top of my
thing to make it a miss click from crit
but a won't walk and I wonder how Ana's

2223
03:00:46,130 --> 03:00:49,040
gonna recover this time around we saw in
the void game the lane might have been a

2224
03:00:49,040 --> 03:00:52,430
little bit hard but he recovered nicely
this time around he just feels harder

2225
03:00:52,430 --> 03:00:57,739
there Lane his Rubik jogger how are they
supposed to kill it in this Lane it's an

2226
03:00:57,739 --> 03:01:02,630
anti mage in a willow you can maybe you
could get a lift on the willow and toss

2227
03:01:02,630 --> 03:01:05,239
it into a spin but it's not enough
damage and the answer may just just

2228
03:01:05,239 --> 03:01:08,630
flat-out on kilovolt look at willow just
leaving art easy even to go into mid

2229
03:01:08,630 --> 03:01:14,180
they're trying to get thompson crambles
he was standing almost smack back in the

2230
03:01:14,180 --> 03:01:17,779
middle of one of crit he just moves a
little bit further north and dodges nice

2231
03:01:17,779 --> 03:01:20,870
moving from talks in there I could have
absolutely gonna kill him and what does

2232
03:01:20,870 --> 03:01:23,930
an ER intern tell do instantly alright
well the time to do some damage towards

2233
03:01:23,930 --> 03:01:29,120
RTZ hopefully I get one Trinity got one
oh he got tossed on top step to the

2234
03:01:29,120 --> 03:01:33,680
tower to D oh no you can't die here
that's real real bad pierogies laning

2235
03:01:33,680 --> 03:01:38,540
but it's not a big kill
now jerax it might have to they might

2236
03:01:38,540 --> 03:01:41,810
have to yield on the bounty runes to
here's no one chance to sell him out so
okay we'll get three rooms or eg sorry

2237
03:01:43,700 --> 03:01:48,110
we'll get three runs it maybe even for
some male let's move it over for it that

2238
03:01:48,110 --> 03:01:51,410
was too late for runes and a kill on the
edge

2239
03:01:51,410 --> 03:01:55,479
several is out of position it got tossed
I like our fly is not even grabbing it

2240
03:01:55,479 --> 03:01:59,090
he's waiting it out maybe he's even got
some bottle charge as if he wants to

2241
03:01:59,090 --> 03:02:03,080
help out gee rocks waiting on the top
lane as far as nearby no turn for the

2242
03:02:03,080 --> 03:02:06,350
frost quick banker and a thing they've
got your eyes he's in bits for the

2243
03:02:06,350 --> 03:02:09,070
moment the tree toss a little bit on
target Purex

2244
03:02:09,070 --> 03:02:13,220
able to dodge but this is some time
that's been wasted by it's a male

2245
03:02:13,220 --> 03:02:16,880
looking for this kill he'll take the
catapult up on top the top is in

2246
03:02:16,880 --> 03:02:20,660
recovery mode admit while this rotation
doesn't then a kill

2247
03:02:20,660 --> 03:02:25,450
are you gonna swap their lanes so tiny
go Smith now or what's the plan here

2248
03:02:25,450 --> 03:02:30,440
empty like this is a bit odd I think
they're trying to wait until s4 returns

2249
03:02:30,440 --> 03:02:34,310
slaying it now the TV happens now at
least half a level behind Thompson
though Anna is getting forever routed by

2250
03:02:38,840 --> 03:02:43,820
crate on bottom line this one tango left
you'll have to consume the mango you

2251
03:02:43,820 --> 03:02:46,700
know what to have it numbs get the
healing blood down but now is he meant

2252
03:02:46,700 --> 03:02:50,120
to be farming on BS and fall instantly
taken care of by crit

2253
03:02:50,120 --> 03:02:53,660
there's no sustain at all it's almost
like there's no hard for rendered down
here and Fred gets that extra mana

2254
03:02:56,360 --> 03:02:59,270
coming in constantly from the maiden or
he might be dying here though if note so

2255
03:02:59,270 --> 03:03:03,770
it gets the lift
jerax is in range not anymore now he's

2256
03:03:03,770 --> 03:03:06,340
gonna wrap around

2257
03:03:06,810 --> 03:03:13,979
like which ones real I need to choose a
prefer to get the kill her are not easy

2258
03:03:13,979 --> 03:03:17,279
but it seems impossible unless they have
full control pick up throw down

2259
03:03:17,279 --> 03:03:21,959
come on are the spell shields leveled up
and form an ant easy just trades places

2260
03:03:21,959 --> 03:03:26,339
with t-rex and then into bramble on TV
judge Bowen task force arrived with the

2261
03:03:26,339 --> 03:03:32,369
Avalanche trick level 2 in shadow Rome
has more than enough damage a pump and a

2262
03:03:32,369 --> 03:03:37,499
once more his second death of the game
that's gonna be a ring of Hell for it's

2263
03:03:37,499 --> 03:03:45,229
easy now as well coming in a sec going
to be furthering his lead in this Lane I

2264
03:03:45,229 --> 03:03:53,939
almost feel like seth is taunting to try
and get EG to come back to it is

2265
03:03:53,939 --> 03:04:00,060
absolutely muted so in summation of the
Ring of Health will be that bad partner

2266
03:04:00,060 --> 03:04:04,109
to the rats now for the rubic he's going
to continue his farming down here in the

2267
03:04:04,109 --> 03:04:08,279
bottom Lane really big difference hopes
is just had to last like three minutes

2268
03:04:08,279 --> 03:04:12,149
by himself admit lane that's the biggest
difference between the this game and the
other invoker game is that Thompson is

2269
03:04:13,560 --> 03:04:16,770
having a much better time this time
round and we know what kind of temple he

2270
03:04:16,770 --> 03:04:21,899
can set for his team this kind of games
but does he have targets it's hard to
kill willow as invoker it's hard to kill

2271
03:04:23,939 --> 03:04:28,579
the answer mages invoker it's hard to
kill Marana as invoker and even the tiny

2272
03:04:28,579 --> 03:04:33,390
targets it's easy to kill Maiden
it's almost like you need to pick up an

2273
03:04:33,390 --> 03:04:37,379
orchid in order to kill some of these
guys camellia County you back he needs

2274
03:04:37,379 --> 03:04:40,859
someone to combine with but the best the
best player for him to combine with is a

2275
03:04:40,859 --> 03:04:44,010
saint convinced a lot of might wanna
play now MP didn't see a check out so

2276
03:04:44,010 --> 03:04:47,819
make sure there's no blink away and on
TZ fell chills weren't helped you that

2277
03:04:47,819 --> 03:04:52,409
poor man gank the lifts and instantly
back in the mid lane he'll miss one

2278
03:04:52,409 --> 03:04:56,159
melee creep so efficient from Thompson's
rotations but each is trying one of

2279
03:04:56,159 --> 03:05:00,299
their own under entire observer said
you've been tolling for a while you've

2280
03:05:00,299 --> 03:05:04,960
been asking eg to kill you and uh well
you may get exactly what you wish for
yes the one level up in attendance stick

2281
03:05:06,970 --> 03:05:10,300
charges but he's got the cursed crown on
him he can't walk this off the teepees

2282
03:05:10,300 --> 03:05:14,529
coming in from Rubik Motel we'll look to
create the space and said well he can

2283
03:05:14,529 --> 03:05:18,279
walk it off
even with his treatise from s4 I don't

2284
03:05:18,279 --> 03:05:23,250
think he's got enough damage and even no
tell deborde's the office

2285
03:05:24,940 --> 03:05:29,860
Thompson being super annoying MIT RTC
does of the maid nor are those so we'll

2286
03:05:29,860 --> 03:05:34,180
get mana for bling a bit sooner
has the stick charges if he really needs

2287
03:05:34,180 --> 03:05:38,200
to blink sepsis moving garment say okay
well curse from me toxins ready to fight

2288
03:05:38,200 --> 03:05:42,340
Thompson in fact please said stop me sir
s4l de Bergerac he gets a double son of

2289
03:05:42,340 --> 03:05:46,030
a third they get the Televisa grabber
over on s4 but Urich he's focusing over

2290
03:05:46,030 --> 03:05:49,420
on fringe uses that call snap for the
control has more now comes up as well up

2291
03:05:49,420 --> 03:05:52,930
the hill realize it's OG earned this
part of the map with the impetus he

2292
03:05:52,930 --> 03:05:56,351
actually get the damage he'll die for
the ball t-rex mother perfect layer but

2293
03:05:56,351 --> 03:06:00,130
it'll still work nonetheless amount been
burned out of matter he's ball charging
up from seven needs to give the intended

2294
03:06:01,660 --> 03:06:05,110
herbivores tops now they can turn their
attack over fly he's arrived as well

2295
03:06:05,110 --> 03:06:08,320
looking for that damage if they got
notes Amell has to leave distance to get

2296
03:06:08,320 --> 03:06:12,190
away to safety and crit he wants to turn
around Thompson I guess that cursed

2297
03:06:12,190 --> 03:06:16,780
route it's gonna get the stun the cost
it will not be enough life in sustain to

2298
03:06:16,780 --> 03:06:21,670
keep Thompson alive and somehow will
quite happily take that kill man there's

2299
03:06:21,670 --> 03:06:25,180
so much happening on the map right now
and guess who the biggest winner is as

2300
03:06:25,180 --> 03:06:31,120
it always is with og was bottom the
whole time so much space being made for

2301
03:06:31,120 --> 03:06:34,780
him he's caught up he's actually
overtaking our TZ now after that very

2302
03:06:34,780 --> 03:06:37,510
difficult laning station in the
beginning the one kill they got fought

2303
03:06:37,510 --> 03:06:42,280
him and then this move mid just created
a lot of time for him ten minute ruins

2304
03:06:42,280 --> 03:06:46,061
here we go again if you thought it was
gonna sim it down your axe will take the
bounty to begin with and looking up the

2305
03:06:47,500 --> 03:06:50,200
walk straight to your actual could
actually come through it's a level 3

2306
03:06:50,200 --> 03:06:54,400
bara so he's not in range the Shadowrun
being used to protect crypts at the
moment he'll slap an extra attack into

2307
03:06:57,280 --> 03:07:01,740
downtown for sure
meanwhile top to the Lord in mid lane

2308
03:07:01,740 --> 03:07:06,250
yeah it feels like the old classic is
you said like Anika's base but then when

2309
03:07:06,250 --> 03:07:09,101
you go down the deal without a you deal
with another line then Thompson gets

2310
03:07:09,101 --> 03:07:13,630
face like which poison do you want to
die to here
the only other choice is to kill them

2311
03:07:15,890 --> 03:07:18,350
all
EMP tornado from Thompson in mid crit

2312
03:07:18,350 --> 03:07:21,710
he's ready to move around and work here
with flight sim l will take the dummy's
got the one shot for the cars crowded

2313
03:07:23,210 --> 03:07:28,970
burgers are walking out of here you know
go in this but avoid help in the

2314
03:07:28,970 --> 03:07:32,479
meantime go arteezy is not getting
single creep OG are putting their own

2315
03:07:32,479 --> 03:07:37,850
pressure on top where it's easiest plank
with the seats creep CP Aussies he jumps

2316
03:07:37,850 --> 03:07:41,090
in untouchable that takes a long time to
get one attack into seven and move into

2317
03:07:41,090 --> 03:07:44,449
the trees the attendants just get they
gonna wear off right now but on TVs

2318
03:07:44,449 --> 03:07:48,199
blinked himself forward sir
Sam is quite happy to do max damage that

2319
03:07:48,199 --> 03:07:54,080
an teammates quicker scroungy racks
he's got far strike available weights

2320
03:07:54,080 --> 03:07:57,290
down nicely get the thumb through the
chatter Roman and dodge is the Arabs to

2321
03:07:57,290 --> 03:08:01,100
bail a little light and now that leaves
crit straight it's a little to no damage

2322
03:08:01,100 --> 03:08:04,760
he can do to get any kind of rebuttal in
the rest of his team is left and

2323
03:08:04,760 --> 03:08:07,430
pathetic
I think the arrow wasn't ready or Samil

2324
03:08:07,430 --> 03:08:11,420
would have definitely got that on the
ground probably had a minor pull down

2325
03:08:11,420 --> 03:08:15,489
from the muse it

2326
03:08:16,100 --> 03:08:20,239
later our it go thrown at the end yeah
yeah that was that was a guaranteed

2327
03:08:20,239 --> 03:08:23,450
stunted music earlier so maybe it was
uncool down there

2328
03:08:23,450 --> 03:08:27,020
as fall will be pressuring bottom
although this is happening yes and what

2329
03:08:27,020 --> 03:08:31,250
is set to steps gonna defend it for now
it just walks in that's fine boy these

2330
03:08:31,250 --> 03:08:34,750
creams gonna do that don't they'll swing
their arms up in the air

2331
03:08:34,750 --> 03:08:42,260
well Detroit what it's a lovely
sentiment hey my girl hey I got you with

2332
03:08:42,260 --> 03:08:45,229
the Ghostbusters man I got you with a
ghost but all I'm thinking about though

2333
03:08:45,229 --> 03:08:51,920
yeah does anyone even know what that
song is or are we just are we just

2334
03:08:51,920 --> 03:09:04,790
proving our age really harps are speedy
but no weapon answer is amiss for I want

2335
03:09:04,790 --> 03:09:08,960
to try on oughta hear this kill is
definitely flat-out impossible for these
two heroes he can spin seed yo

2336
03:09:10,710 --> 03:09:15,479
Trump with the Avalanche never repeated
because I have a team I'm the only one

2337
03:09:15,479 --> 03:09:18,899
she reacted me of mine he made the virus
retrieves his base or he's just like

2338
03:09:18,899 --> 03:09:22,050
okay Hannah I'm sorry Ben
you can only sauce if you want to but

2339
03:09:22,050 --> 03:09:27,060
okay I didn't click him to check
identity fee before that but eg very

2340
03:09:27,060 --> 03:09:30,960
clearly did and they ran him down that
is a huge kill he was the richest here

2341
03:09:30,960 --> 03:09:39,090
on the map once or twice in every game
on us just being left alone and will get

2342
03:09:39,090 --> 03:09:42,330
killed once in a while
I remember the analyst bounce I'm

2343
03:09:42,330 --> 03:09:46,050
talking about like the way edgy play is
like hey we're up on the top lane and it

2344
03:09:46,050 --> 03:09:48,870
was always said who was gonna the one
who was out to bars like hey come and

2345
03:09:48,870 --> 03:09:52,350
kill me how many heroes did it take from
you Jeep to kill off the juggernaut yeah

2346
03:09:52,350 --> 03:09:56,910
he's worth a lot but then he get heavy
damage into the t1 towers seven who was

2347
03:09:56,910 --> 03:10:00,120
the number one they're giving more back
into him and he's go trying to return it

2348
03:10:00,120 --> 03:10:05,880
in where the drums build early on and
just add that level of pressure and
meanwhile tops and also farming up

2349
03:10:07,410 --> 03:10:14,279
straight industry reversal know how to
bind us on this invoker and there's

2350
03:10:14,279 --> 03:10:17,760
another big item coming up soon this is
one is for he G though it's gonna be the

2351
03:10:17,760 --> 03:10:22,439
dagger for s4 and a hundred gold some
really good targets for him in this game

2352
03:10:22,439 --> 03:10:25,770
a lot of the radiant heroes don't have
too much max he'll through the rubix

2353
03:10:25,770 --> 03:10:28,800
afford dice very easily
the invoker dies really easily The
Enchantress also dies easily if there's

2354
03:10:30,840 --> 03:10:37,109
a little bit of follow up speaking of a
chance to actually again but most of all

2355
03:10:37,109 --> 03:10:40,529
coming in after the cover of smoke to
both sides parties he was being hunted

2356
03:10:40,529 --> 03:10:46,020
but that's his game sense is tingling he
just moves away and goes down to the

2357
03:10:46,020 --> 03:10:49,859
Trinity camera talking about I'm being
conveyed to my own jungle the observers

2358
03:10:49,859 --> 03:10:53,609
and sentries now being deep water power
water plane said okay bye

2359
03:10:53,609 --> 03:11:01,640
hey Rosie M Channel full duration they
threw everything in the kitchen enemies
not just the sink that time I'll get a

2360
03:11:05,340 --> 03:11:10,649
lot of it back smells found a
regeneration rate and bottom river so

2361
03:11:10,649 --> 03:11:18,779
male not scaling home like she had oh by
the way what is this waiting for the 200

2362
03:11:18,779 --> 03:11:23,100
health instead it can be really useful
for for his team like it can be the

2363
03:11:23,100 --> 03:11:26,819
difference-maker but whether am survives
a gank or not is that worth one point in

2364
03:11:26,819 --> 03:11:29,029
arrow

2365
03:11:29,600 --> 03:11:34,859
okay that's gonna wondering too like how
you would build it we were we're kind of

2366
03:11:34,859 --> 03:11:37,439
tossing up like whether you get a lot of
your physical damage from like how do

2367
03:11:37,439 --> 03:11:40,590
you make sure you like obviously there's
no physical feel coming in this time

2368
03:11:40,590 --> 03:11:43,770
around there's 200 health but not going
to 15 damage he's going into academic

2369
03:11:43,770 --> 03:11:48,600
septum huge laying clearance and
something that Archie may not have an

2370
03:11:48,600 --> 03:11:53,010
easy answer to like both calls it going
for battle Furies but and mage as well

2371
03:11:53,010 --> 03:11:57,080
as piranhas they clean waves up so
quickly in this so highly maneuverable

2372
03:11:57,080 --> 03:12:04,739
mid tower TP comes in the quick spin
from Adam the fear will be there and

2373
03:12:04,739 --> 03:12:07,949
that's gonna force the Enchantress to
run away and is in pretty deep she let's

2374
03:12:07,949 --> 03:12:10,529
don't be such a bobble in the heavy
amount of damage thanks the demon ed edd

2375
03:12:10,529 --> 03:12:15,750
crit well he'll stand that and he'll
tank the entire Omni slash the rest of

2376
03:12:15,750 --> 03:12:19,949
eg back up behind the tier 2 it was a
good idea from s4 but he missed the toss

2377
03:12:19,949 --> 03:12:23,430
on the jugger he tossed a creep instead
that got in the way said you're coming

2378
03:12:23,430 --> 03:12:27,869
in deep man like they're under a shrine
he's got a lot more avalanche tops off

2379
03:12:27,869 --> 03:12:31,260
into the arrow and Thompson's trying to
help out with the call stop pushing

2380
03:12:31,260 --> 03:12:33,390
smell away
enchantress now I'm gonna get this price

2381
03:12:33,390 --> 03:12:37,909
off 30 tell still there the mattify not
be easy

2382
03:12:42,689 --> 03:12:46,689
let's eat he's not gonna be happy with
them on the are from Sibel well on

2383
03:12:46,689 --> 03:12:49,720
target of your burger cause that's
coming up cool down right now the coast
rod ball everyone stand together against

2384
03:12:51,939 --> 03:12:55,060
done maybe there's some damage from the
bedlam but the de Barras records your

2385
03:12:55,060 --> 03:13:02,770
act is picking a print and this game is
escalated quickly meanwhile Anna up in

2386
03:13:02,770 --> 03:13:11,140
Norway Bobby the top lane it feels like
I don't know how Enchantress manages to
do this in her games to just tempt

2387
03:13:12,640 --> 03:13:16,960
everyone to try for these hard kills if
it's just a tilt effect like you get

2388
03:13:16,960 --> 03:13:21,880
annoyed you're like just kill the
Enchantress button let's just get him

2389
03:13:21,880 --> 03:13:25,510
let's just go
it's it's really close to eg here that

2390
03:13:25,510 --> 03:13:29,380
they try to go for these enchantra
skills they've I mean they've got two on
her but how many have they failed and

2391
03:13:30,790 --> 03:13:34,930
how much time is that cost them it's
custom a lot juggernaut has finished at

2392
03:13:34,930 --> 03:13:40,989
battlefury before the anti-mage wave
arteezy's not even close he's 2,000 gold

2393
03:13:40,989 --> 03:13:48,640
away from it right now the car often
golden experience gets to swing up eg

2394
03:13:48,640 --> 03:13:53,710
has obliged oh gee with a lot of fights
but they need to be able to settle this

2395
03:13:53,710 --> 03:13:58,720
game down they need the items they need
the split-push they need the battlefury

2396
03:13:58,720 --> 03:14:02,470
they need a lot of things but what is RG
doing not giving them the room to

2397
03:14:02,470 --> 03:14:06,970
breathe already attacking into the tea
to town on bottom Lane the tempo is so

2398
03:14:06,970 --> 03:14:11,200
high now from og now they can kind of do
whatever they want

2399
03:14:11,200 --> 03:14:16,090
st. King will get a dagger very soon yep
they're gonna drive or no tell stand up

2400
03:14:16,090 --> 03:14:19,120
continuously but they'll still get the
grime pulling back down again for a

2401
03:14:19,120 --> 03:14:21,490
strike to fumble because your s4 does
not get up the hill
cross fight from flying car create

2402
03:14:22,990 --> 03:14:27,160
enough space and there is no other
support coming in from EEG I said I was

2403
03:14:27,160 --> 03:14:33,400
coming from oh gee and now it's a 17
minute blink dagger for a support SK for

2404
03:14:33,400 --> 03:14:37,780
wondering how you can make these two
very not financially viable supports

2405
03:14:37,780 --> 03:14:41,800
where's over hard five but this works
when GX as a blink dagger as fast as the
normal off winner to get them smell gets

2406
03:14:47,320 --> 03:14:54,189
the TV very onset about fighting against
ye receive them with that DD and you was

2407
03:14:54,189 --> 03:14:59,710
thinking about it didn't want to go home
good observer some centuries from eg G
rack so he'll cop that our still in the

2408
03:15:01,720 --> 03:15:05,290
century it's about me saying that killed
nice and quick and then s4 he'll jump in

2409
03:15:05,290 --> 03:15:08,620
as well they're going up the support to
nip dollars a mile with a double kill

2410
03:15:08,620 --> 03:15:11,770
turn your attention okay one step will
take a long time to attack into him the

2411
03:15:11,770 --> 03:15:15,100
EMP button poles are there from Thompson
making life a little bit more difficult

2412
03:15:15,100 --> 03:15:19,600
for the doc Willard said he wants to
battle they have century but the century

2413
03:15:19,600 --> 03:15:22,990
somebody get rid of that flies moving
forward you can definitely see them best

2414
03:15:22,990 --> 03:15:31,810
that trees
oh that's a good combo really good jump

2415
03:15:31,810 --> 03:15:35,800
in the prandtl he'll catch on Anna he's
got ami / he could turn around right now

2416
03:15:35,800 --> 03:15:39,580
there's only one 3% they're doing all
the spin damage into his father he have

2417
03:15:39,580 --> 03:15:47,560
to burn the ultimate Ravana Phil Tandy
I think it's four or sorry not as far I

2418
03:15:47,560 --> 03:15:51,610
think some male couldn't arrow because
seven just kept running in front of him

2419
03:15:51,610 --> 03:15:55,570
so they couldn't calm that to get
another kill the observed was less than

2420
03:15:55,570 --> 03:16:02,740
saying fly he knew he had to dodge moved
out to the side and then just his easy

2421
03:16:02,740 --> 03:16:05,649
pickings I'd love to see a replay of
that because that was so beautifully

2422
03:16:05,649 --> 03:16:09,700
executed from Ichi how they did the
avalanche toss into the terrorize on the

2423
03:16:09,700 --> 03:16:13,390
on the jugger all they needed was to
connect an arrow but I think septa
strand in front of the of the sumela

2424
03:16:15,430 --> 03:16:18,610
Rama and he couldn't land it that's got
to be what happened and that's huge for

2425
03:16:18,610 --> 03:16:21,820
the alcohol outcome of that instead of
losing their biggest core they get two

2426
03:16:21,820 --> 03:16:26,080
kills
I'm sure our T's Kang some space but man

2427
03:16:26,080 --> 03:16:30,460
this is by his standard super late
battle fury and he had a good start -

2428
03:16:30,460 --> 03:16:34,930
Chris set EMP tornado catching him up on
the tone machete Rome will add some

2429
03:16:34,930 --> 03:16:38,140
protection he's got no man to work with
forget the damage in - Darnell hung

2430
03:16:38,140 --> 03:16:42,310
around a little longer Aaron and flies
for a nice long five seconds Dunham

2431
03:16:42,310 --> 03:16:48,460
Harbor on the Rubicon now guard Adam fly
they tell Thompson eg they needed

2432
03:16:48,460 --> 03:16:51,750
something and that's something

2433
03:16:51,850 --> 03:16:58,989
Sam okay I'll do this over maybe I'll
work matt is near buying not easy though

2434
03:16:58,989 --> 03:17:04,919
Travis fell up and running and it's not
gonna take that risk of it Omni slash

2435
03:17:05,430 --> 03:17:09,339
maybe now it's time to pick up those
boundaries for from on the field the P

2436
03:17:09,339 --> 03:17:13,390
net for 30 seconds an unusual occurrence
for 20 minute Bonnie routes yeah but

2437
03:17:13,390 --> 03:17:21,909
it's just so much fighting with 26 kills
20 minutes into the game smell with the

2438
03:17:21,909 --> 03:17:27,010
scouting arrow if jarek's knew he would
have taken the other one I think he's in

2439
03:17:27,010 --> 03:17:31,390
my as well he gets one that's I think
three for one trade I'm bouncer in some

2440
03:17:31,390 --> 03:17:37,779
total once Anna gives a shit together
and takes this one wants to push the way

2441
03:17:37,779 --> 03:17:42,789
first that's fine now he's gonna take it
on the way back but Kemp jaracz is

2442
03:17:42,789 --> 03:17:50,109
really just trying to stay on RTZ like a
tic tac doing this to just annoy us it's

2443
03:17:50,109 --> 03:17:54,550
income it's coming in value maybe one
goal but its value
he felt like nobody from eg was gonna

2444
03:17:56,319 --> 03:17:59,739
come and try to take them because it was
not set up as a bait there was nobody

2445
03:17:59,739 --> 03:18:03,939
there that would have killed on the road
yeah like Retief up ups up attack speed

2446
03:18:03,939 --> 03:18:09,069
increase 500 damage by 10 and Roshan
difficult to kill off once again this

2447
03:18:09,069 --> 03:18:15,310
enchantress you've been running Shawn
thinks he's untouchable but what is eg

2448
03:18:15,310 --> 03:18:19,720
do they scan Roshan they know what's
going on but how fast can you move over

2449
03:18:19,720 --> 03:18:24,669
you'll gathering for a smoke but Raja is
practically dead one point for K 1 K and

2450
03:18:24,669 --> 03:18:30,220
da bagon said going for her one nothing
TP over does nothing they stay with the

2451
03:18:30,220 --> 03:18:32,399
lanes

2452
03:18:32,641 --> 03:18:36,400
and Jared sassette up bottom they want
to connect over and try to kill our it's

2453
03:18:36,400 --> 03:18:41,200
easy probably never mind just gonna push
out the wave discount a spelling just in

2454
03:18:41,200 --> 03:18:44,530
case
Oh G can move up through minute it has

2455
03:18:44,530 --> 03:18:48,521
been the name of their game throughout
this tournament 20 minutes 22 minutes

2456
03:18:48,521 --> 03:18:56,230
hits let's go hi Graham boys out of the
front line up alacrity give up
able to get quick entangle but paint

2457
03:18:59,200 --> 03:19:03,700
spindles are great Madame Simone's
getting some level of damage they have

2458
03:19:03,700 --> 03:19:08,200
so much sustain that The Enchantress
yield they have healing Ward they're

2459
03:19:08,200 --> 03:19:10,721
gonna go in with the next wave he has
the spendin Allegra T they're just gonna
slowly shift this down and our T's in

2460
03:19:12,940 --> 03:19:16,181
the meantime has to try to get as much
as possible if they don't want to take

2461
03:19:16,181 --> 03:19:22,150
this fight because realistically OG are
not favored in this here we go again

2462
03:19:22,150 --> 03:19:26,891
spin attack for to fight has to be used
that's easy is he said like he's

2463
03:19:26,891 --> 03:19:31,150
refusing to join this fight eg just have
to hold the high ground they might have

2464
03:19:31,150 --> 03:19:35,081
to lose the racks to actually before
they can find it I think are teasing

2465
03:19:35,081 --> 03:19:38,681
without Manta in this game is it's not
going to be particularly useful thompson

2466
03:19:38,681 --> 03:19:43,721
taunting 460 murray speed and side to
that Ghost Walk now aim for a target
actually just decide to smoke like that

2467
03:19:45,761 --> 03:19:49,440
no you're acting off this became pretty
obvious to our TZ that something is up

2468
03:19:49,440 --> 03:19:53,860
but he doesn't this is the thing about
bostwick's invoker compared to exhort

2469
03:19:53,860 --> 03:19:58,251
hookers and hookers playing this build
are generally really high on mana so

2470
03:19:58,251 --> 03:20:01,131
you will be looking for okay maybe our
Caesar can come in toward the end of the

2471
03:20:01,131 --> 03:20:05,061
fight get a big mata boy that gets kills
but if you hit this EMP on a couple of

2472
03:20:05,061 --> 03:20:09,261
heroes you're super high on Lana the
whole time and even that won't be an

2473
03:20:09,261 --> 03:20:12,891
option for him
he's coming out moonlight shudder and

2474
03:20:12,891 --> 03:20:16,341
smug being committed they want to wrap
around the pack they want to do

2475
03:20:16,341 --> 03:20:19,280
something about your axe probably needed
a ward up on this hillside to make it

2476
03:20:19,280 --> 03:20:21,921
happen
CMS got one per century and observer

2477
03:20:21,921 --> 03:20:25,911
lion drops the Sentry to begin with
observer straight after the one that's

2478
03:20:25,911 --> 03:20:29,661
been happening there was no defenceman
tier 3 Tower is done with even a couple

2479
03:20:29,661 --> 03:20:36,440
of creeps to help the push skirt spins
now he's going to take the melee rax you

2480
03:20:36,440 --> 03:20:41,271
said EG may have to pay the price that
talks but they find one indeed step onto

2481
03:20:41,271 --> 03:20:45,081
the tier 4 towers the arrow looking to
gauges welcome the only size heads for

2482
03:20:45,081 --> 03:20:49,011
he's just totally shredded Anna will
find the kilt apply for Medicare Anna

2483
03:20:49,011 --> 03:20:53,061
taking through all of this however it
says the stain I thought eg amiss be

2484
03:20:53,061 --> 03:20:55,701
Captain America but oh geez they could
do this all day

2485
03:20:55,701 --> 03:21:00,021
and the concept there's something to
follow it up for teenage beat the dog

2486
03:21:00,021 --> 03:21:05,780
undertale beast on the play preventing
page it jumps did fuck cause you could

2487
03:21:05,780 --> 03:21:08,751
do that
find the kilt size chased up over on top

2488
03:21:08,751 --> 03:21:12,411
to 5 tickets up at this no one from EG
who can get close to GX come to when the

2489
03:21:12,411 --> 03:21:17,360
epicenter takes pretty easy to engage
but they're not they're a dodgy look for

2490
03:21:17,360 --> 03:21:22,320
another lane of rats
pushing through print he's got the chip

2491
03:21:22,320 --> 03:21:26,610
damage into Thompson where's your jump
on TV is still farming a mid-weight

2492
03:21:26,610 --> 03:21:31,290
he will not join any majors don't finish
bombing but as for dead Persephone's

2493
03:21:31,290 --> 03:21:35,820
Atkins
he's losing and team mates and what does
our TV wanna turn the ends of the Nancy

2494
03:21:39,511 --> 03:21:47,101
veins keep on farming what are you gonna
do keep on pushing down good to me

2495
03:21:47,101 --> 03:21:53,971
there's no tiny 450 seconds this is it's
it's over they don't have the damage
they can't kill these heroes I think

2496
03:21:55,170 --> 03:22:01,141
jump in hook via target piranha Sam bail
he's leaping the wrong direction but he

2497
03:22:01,141 --> 03:22:03,960
had no other choice
he tried to get the active stammer out

2498
03:22:03,960 --> 03:22:09,300
and damage out but now he doesn't have a
way free hottie he's trying to grab the

2499
03:22:09,300 --> 03:22:11,880
free weights but they're all pushed in
the bottom Plains pushed in which is

2500
03:22:11,880 --> 03:22:15,990
allowing this pressure from our G up on
the top as fly man Shira

2501
03:22:15,990 --> 03:22:19,830
he doesn't get to reach the goal
defensive guilt upper available there

2502
03:22:19,830 --> 03:22:24,030
we'll get some chip damage in the Nortel
but hey he has to fight me gave me his

2503
03:22:24,030 --> 03:22:28,790
number on TV the time he picked up

2504
03:22:30,279 --> 03:22:34,430
well no cheap one kill first
roads in their town they'll blink away

2505
03:22:34,430 --> 03:22:59,390
regeneration is required right now the
culture on the side of Mirchi Seth will

2506
03:22:59,390 --> 03:23:03,680
get himself a double kill the turn big
cause if the serve mom Hagen see what'll

2507
03:23:03,680 --> 03:23:08,239
get out of a kid's life they claiming
the range racks niggas are up 26 minutes

2508
03:23:08,239 --> 03:23:14,060
in eg I'm older on the roads it's a
tired rope third net not Bali setting

2509
03:23:14,060 --> 03:23:20,180
the rope foot fire this happened really
fast

2510
03:23:20,180 --> 03:23:24,260
I just want to point out how fast this
happened the game was really really even

2511
03:23:24,260 --> 03:23:30,169
from first 15 minutes and then we have
this one moment where og get multiple

2512
03:23:30,169 --> 03:23:35,390
kills our teaser shows up and dies and
since then it's been oh geez all the way

2513
03:23:35,390 --> 03:23:39,079
to get the Rose they go push with
they're invincible jugger with healing

2514
03:23:39,079 --> 03:23:44,119
awesome ale up in the air cause nothing
can leap away this is a last chance for

2515
03:23:44,119 --> 03:23:52,100
eg ol 5 players up there is no Raxus $94
to really speak oh just the one piranha

2516
03:23:52,100 --> 03:23:56,239
jumps in banana still stands his ground
where's the attack

2517
03:23:56,239 --> 03:24:01,010
eg gather all the dirt ala flag looking
for an opportunity and Atta he's begging

2518
03:24:01,010 --> 03:24:04,850
for it he's gone bad and Sol he's ready
to touch that are into the trees ite

2519
03:24:04,850 --> 03:24:08,959
blinks away a maybe tops him he'll be
set up towards the end the cars crown is

2520
03:24:08,959 --> 03:24:10,540
there
he'll be out to get the nice chain stuff

2521
03:24:10,540 --> 03:24:14,170
here it's all online Monty these goodies
include damage that sends away by the

2522
03:24:14,170 --> 03:24:18,460
terrorize not easy to man avoid it's
good but is it good enough just a former
geez they continue to run on TV printed

2523
03:24:20,590 --> 03:24:23,710
by the BKB
yes jump back in again trip has for they
even get the tornado Manju aunty the are

2524
03:24:25,810 --> 03:24:29,080
trim the tree line
goodbye the lights are going out for

2525
03:24:29,080 --> 03:24:35,350
ichi right now but the lien this is the
winner's bracket butter cheese they will

2526
03:24:35,350 --> 03:24:42,069
push fallen to the winner's bracket
final repeating the history of TI a to

2527
03:24:42,069 --> 03:24:47,910
Wooding ichi in this semi-final to

2528
03:24:50,729 --> 03:24:54,840
that's you know what

2529
03:24:57,410 --> 03:25:01,700
this game is answer me in a nutshell
right now if you you have a good start

2530
03:25:01,700 --> 03:25:07,250
you have a good landing stage this hero
it needs time it needs space art easy

2531
03:25:07,250 --> 03:25:09,950
with just these two deaths and the
limited farm that he ended up having

2532
03:25:09,950 --> 03:25:14,720
just gets overtaken he gets eclipsed by
this juggernaut super quickly and then
when it comes to defense well guess what

2533
03:25:16,160 --> 03:25:19,700
you have an intimation it's kind of
moron 5og run them over they put so much

2534
03:25:19,700 --> 03:25:23,870
pressure to take the rose they go for
all the ranks in one streak and they

2535
03:25:23,870 --> 03:25:28,550
just they made it look really easy but
there's in this replay for eg this like
one or two moments ago I look back and

2536
03:25:30,020 --> 03:25:33,620
be like man if we don't go for the
Enchantress this game is so different

2537
03:25:33,620 --> 03:25:37,430
and this this hero is proving to be a
huge problem if won all three games in

2538
03:25:37,430 --> 03:25:42,200
the series goes a big big nuisance to
the other team in all three of the games

2539
03:25:42,200 --> 03:25:44,810
but you gotta against og you got a
chance
what do you on a bang you gotta do

2540
03:25:46,460 --> 03:25:50,600
something Archie then looking absolutely
amazing if with a tire if without Mac

2541
03:25:50,600 --> 03:25:54,560
they are a wall claws team looking to
potentially be the first team to get

2542
03:25:54,560 --> 03:25:59,720
back-to-back victories will it be
possible they look good they look

2543
03:25:59,720 --> 03:26:04,760
amazing doubt as if you thought lost you
was maybe a fluke ergy looking to prove

2544
03:26:04,760 --> 03:26:10,510
it right now the cool and was definitely
happy

2545
03:26:12,280 --> 03:26:18,320
very happy indeed a year in between two
of the same rosters meeting on the
ground state

2546
03:26:23,220 --> 03:26:42,870
[Music]

2547
03:26:45,760 --> 03:27:30,520
[Music]

2548
03:27:31,880 --> 03:27:33,939
you

2549
03:27:36,990 --> 03:27:40,920
terrorize this spot you may see some
little rocks lingering around

2550
03:27:40,920 --> 03:27:46,260
it was just freshly avalanched seems
like a real recipe for success right in

2551
03:27:46,260 --> 03:27:51,690
comes enchantress you see harmless
elantris

2552
03:27:51,690 --> 03:27:57,930
well she seems harmless until she what's
that there was an arrow there was an

2553
03:27:57,930 --> 03:28:02,580
arrow coming in from Morana it should
have just directly directly hit s for

2554
03:28:02,580 --> 03:28:07,200
life would have been grand no and said
and chance was tanks it and everyone

2555
03:28:07,200 --> 03:28:09,810
just like well screw that I can't do
anything to her sue Mills running around
he has no idea what to do

2556
03:28:10,950 --> 03:28:14,729
he's cancelled like five Auto attacks
trying to go through untouchable onna
gets out okay

2557
03:28:16,050 --> 03:28:18,870
Samuel is still blue Lee is still trying
he's still trying to auto attack it's

2558
03:28:18,870 --> 03:28:23,070
not gonna happen
enchantress please can I can I get some
weight yeah a pretty good here right

2559
03:28:39,440 --> 03:28:42,870
talk about it right it's like I
definitely think you have to ban the IO

2560
03:28:42,870 --> 03:28:45,870
mag and it's pretty much pick your
poison after that right we've seen

2561
03:28:45,870 --> 03:28:49,110
Chen's ban versum enchantress says eg
ban the alch

2562
03:28:49,110 --> 03:28:53,820
all three games versus um and you know
what that that game like they know G

2563
03:28:53,820 --> 03:28:56,520
just looked dominant I would say going
that Sears they're probably 70/30

2564
03:28:56,520 --> 03:28:59,790
favorites and they showed in that last
game yeah after our first game though I

2565
03:28:59,790 --> 03:29:03,840
was a little worried but we shouldn't
have been that was dominant performance

2566
03:29:03,840 --> 03:29:09,360
on that third game coming out from oh
gee and cornerstone of the og squad is

2567
03:29:09,360 --> 03:29:13,320
with Casey right now it's Derek's oh I
love that title shaver calls you the

2568
03:29:13,320 --> 03:29:20,190
cornerstone of the og squad it's a no
we're actually on camera now so yeah

2569
03:29:20,190 --> 03:29:25,590
what do you think
cornerstone oh no you don't know what

2570
03:29:25,590 --> 03:29:30,570
are you talking about let my teammates
talk okay yeah maybe think I said you're

2571
03:29:30,570 --> 03:29:34,050
being way too humble
can I get try to get inside your psyche

2572
03:29:34,050 --> 03:29:37,080
for a minute because every time I
interview you guys I ask how you're able

2573
03:29:37,080 --> 03:29:40,920
to make incredible comebacks time and
time again and you always say we trust

2574
03:29:40,920 --> 03:29:45,540
each other and I get that but as someone
who has failed a lot in life if I were

2575
03:29:45,540 --> 03:29:49,190
to have a game not go very well and then
I have to turn around and

2576
03:29:49,190 --> 03:29:53,921
come back I wouldn't be able to do it I
get in my head how do you not do that I

2577
03:29:53,921 --> 03:29:59,660
mean I think our team is very hungry
and they're very passionate I think it

2578
03:29:59,660 --> 03:30:04,910
carries us basically all these bigger
tournaments and somehow it just triggers

2579
03:30:04,910 --> 03:30:11,290
a TI and I think that kind of sets us to
the whatever we are having right now and

2580
03:30:11,290 --> 03:30:16,730
yeah that helps
we've seen returning ti champs before
and they usually come into the

2581
03:30:17,780 --> 03:30:20,931
tournament and one of the things they
talk about is the pressure they feel and

2582
03:30:20,931 --> 03:30:25,070
it just becomes too much I'm seeing the
opposite from you guys you guys are

2583
03:30:25,070 --> 03:30:29,870
coming in and I don't know if it's a
mental game that you're playing or if

2584
03:30:29,870 --> 03:30:33,620
it's more of just your way of trying to
stay relaxed but you did a coin flip to

2585
03:30:33,620 --> 03:30:37,671
determine who you were going to face
when you first started the the main

2586
03:30:37,671 --> 03:30:44,870
event and we saw the flags with no tails
face on them that you put all over the

2587
03:30:44,870 --> 03:30:50,841
game and game one which was a pretty
funny move yeah I mean this profile

2588
03:30:50,841 --> 03:30:55,341
picture it's just starting to be a meme
now for us I think next game we're gonna

2589
03:30:55,341 --> 03:31:01,311
do something different whatever is
feelings so the the goofy one was

2590
03:31:01,311 --> 03:31:05,181
because para die called us like don't
get into the goofiness and they will

2591
03:31:05,181 --> 03:31:10,160
beat us and then we're just goofy
flagging up on the map well yeah it

2592
03:31:10,160 --> 03:31:14,750
seems it seems to work yeah I think tile
didn't like to lane too much when I was

2593
03:31:14,750 --> 03:31:20,360
describing the flag even on his land he
was on the same lane like two different

2594
03:31:20,360 --> 03:31:24,021
same time it also seems like they like
to mute you so that they don't hear all

2595
03:31:24,021 --> 03:31:31,851
that the chat yeah but then you just tip
okay so and then yeah you need to find

2596
03:31:31,851 --> 03:31:37,610
the ways to get through the mutes
because I mean it's a bit lame you seem

2597
03:31:37,610 --> 03:31:44,660
to like that part of it yeah it's it's
part of it's like a hobby to us yeah are

2598
03:31:44,660 --> 03:31:50,210
you already looking ahead yeah I mean I
want to play more I have a big problem I

2599

2600
03:31:53,811 --> 03:32:00,080

2601

2616
03:33:33,830 --> 03:33:36,620

should have gone through the lower

2617
03:33:36,620 --> 03:33:39,800
bracket cuz that's when you get the
plate tomorrow and now they got away to
full day yep it's gonna be tough you

2618
03:33:42,410 --> 03:33:45,890
know he brought up ranked matchmaking
will you you know we'll see what happens

2619
03:33:45,890 --> 03:33:49,640
with that but as you said I mean they
haven't played mini three-game series

2620
03:33:49,640 --> 03:33:53,000
that was actually the first one they
barely lost games in their group stage

2621
03:33:53,000 --> 03:33:57,439
and og LGD I mean a lot of people had
them as favorites coming out of the

2622
03:33:57,439 --> 03:34:01,939
group stage guess what there they are
they are indeed and you know when when

2623
03:34:01,939 --> 03:34:03,859
the team is playing there's a lot
happening

2624
03:34:03,859 --> 03:34:08,149
there's obviously everybody watching in
the audience we just by the way packs
which is crazy for a lot of people that

2625
03:34:10,370 --> 03:34:16,030
last public transport might have already
you know went away

2626
03:34:16,150 --> 03:34:20,500
yeah you also watch the game as a coach
and I feel like when you watch the game

2627
03:34:20,500 --> 03:34:27,610
as a coach or as a family member you're
super invested yeah and this is this is

2628
03:34:27,610 --> 03:34:40,890
them watching when you are emotionally
invested in watching crazy things to you
my man sucks he went in he deserved it

2629
03:34:44,680 --> 03:34:47,920
that was you know throughout the
entirety of this tournament

2630
03:34:47,920 --> 03:34:51,940
I think everyone considered that og was
the superior team

2631
03:34:51,940 --> 03:34:55,930
if Yugi won it was because they got some
momentum all of a sudden while they were

2632
03:34:55,930 --> 03:34:58,540
making their upper bracket run or maybe
throughout the course of their group

2633
03:34:58,540 --> 03:35:02,830
stage they finally found their legs
again but it still came out the way that
most people expected og

2634
03:35:04,660 --> 03:35:09,880
moving forward yet again another TI yeah
crazy day of dota 2 not to unexpected

2635
03:35:09,880 --> 03:35:13,570
result but I think unexpected in the way
they happened and if you miss how they

2636
03:35:13,570 --> 03:35:17,800
happened I got the good news for you
because we got a little recap on what

2637
03:35:17,800 --> 03:35:20,430
happened today

2638
03:35:20,730 --> 03:35:25,480
hey baby hope is going forward it's the
gets controlled often does have a goal

as peachy gaming they took their jobs as

2652
03:36:56,250 --> 03:37:02,420
they tried for the Roshan but they now
start to fall

2653
03:37:17,150 --> 03:37:30,631
into play Compton I'm on top thank you
so much damage the pump is there burner

2654
03:37:30,631 --> 03:37:40,471
to control the ESP you water can may be
fun to kill but not easy then decrypt

2655
03:37:40,471 --> 03:37:45,980
I'm gonna light some bourbon and now the
jump ball

2657
03:37:52,030 --> 03:37:54,521
normal BKB
there's normal Road the time to work

2658
03:37:54,521 --> 03:38:00,750
with an RTD Solon life does not have the
son de arriba kills him

2659
03:38:05,209 --> 03:38:11,579
crazy day indeed will I want to know
like I we all see your face in the clip
from cap splashing his watchable around

2660
03:38:13,709 --> 03:38:17,369
I be heard that he normally does have
something in his hand that he just

2661
03:38:17,369 --> 03:38:23,220
twirls around this time unfortunately
there was dude okay so normally he does
do that

2662
03:38:23,550 --> 03:38:27,359
he fidgets yeah we he likes to play
around with stuff and what ended up

2663
03:38:27,359 --> 03:38:31,680
happening was uh I couldn't see when I
turned my head cuz he had it in his

2664
03:38:31,680 --> 03:38:34,800
other hand so I actually thought I
looked mad because I thought somebody
threw water at us like I was really

2665
03:38:36,869 --> 03:38:41,220
confused for like until I saw the cut I
was like okay cuz I had water all over
my glasses on my screen the way that it

2666
03:38:43,379 --> 03:38:45,329
shot out
I actually thought somebody threw water
from behind me like somebody actually

2667
03:38:47,489 --> 03:38:51,329
just dishwater obvious I was like the
hell and then I watched it was

2668
03:38:51,329 --> 03:38:53,879
three-fight yeah then he told me he
apologized and then I saw that it was

2669
03:38:53,879 --> 03:38:59,699
everywhere it actually broke the the
monitor it broke the monitor it halfway

2670
03:38:59,699 --> 03:39:04,709
through the second game cap had a cast
off of my screen because his monitor

2671
03:39:04,709 --> 03:39:11,310
actually just entirely broke don't pour
water bottles or we can take a look at
the bracket see where we are at we have

2672
03:39:13,829 --> 03:39:18,869
said goodbye to two more teams this
morning that means we still go on eight

2673
03:39:18,869 --> 03:39:24,300
teams left in the tournament it's coming
halfway there round yeah we are and we
we didn't really see the infamous clip

2674
03:39:26,399 --> 03:39:31,079
there but those guys are looking really
really good South Americans they go up

2675
03:39:31,079 --> 03:39:35,339
against secret which is gonna be the
first real real real big test for them

2676
03:39:35,339 --> 03:39:39,119
which will be super exciting yeah and
that will happen tomorrow we did see LGD

2677
03:39:39,119 --> 03:39:42,510
and og making it to the opéra bracket
again two years in a row we're gonna see

2678
03:39:42,510 --> 03:39:45,899
them find it out well forget about that
for a bit because that's not until two

2679
03:39:45,899 --> 03:39:50,039
days from now but that lower bracket
will have a portion of that played out

2680
03:39:50,039 --> 03:39:54,449
tomorrow we're gonna kick it off with
orangey versus liquid and the winner of

2681
03:39:54,449 --> 03:40:00,569
that will face Iggy and of course as
Grant says infamous facing secret it's
gonna meet all it's gotta be a very

2682
03:40:01,829 --> 03:40:05,010
exciting one I think we haven't seen a
series yet with the secret that is not

2683
03:40:05,010 --> 03:40:08,699
exciting and that might be a little bit
scary for them because they you know

2684
03:40:08,699 --> 03:40:11,819
that's normally because they mess up but
it's exciting
exactly you can't mess

2685
03:40:13,699 --> 03:40:17,130
because you know exactly what they're
gonna do they've been playing the exact
same strategy the whole time it says

2686
03:40:19,050 --> 03:40:22,800
Chris Lux Schofield we're gonna make
insane amounts of space Hector is the

2687
03:40:22,800 --> 03:40:26,729
most efficient man
I mean 99% Midas timing easy an absolute

2688
03:40:26,729 --> 03:40:29,729
beast
he is indeed beast as well are the 10

2689
03:40:29,729 --> 03:40:34,470
players that you'll see tomorrow in the
all-star match all-star matches all

2690
03:40:34,470 --> 03:40:44,090
random death match and remember today is
Thursday tomorrow's Friday and you're

2691
03:40:44,720 --> 03:40:52,619
locked in by the end of today so you got
a pick a player because depending on how

2692
03:40:52,619 --> 03:40:58,169
good that player performs you're gonna
get battle paws levels that's right free

2693
03:40:58,169 --> 03:41:01,439
stuff free items and there's a
teamradiant

2694
03:41:01,439 --> 03:41:07,020
there is 18 dire I know Trent's got his
money set on Tim's or rather his battle

2695
03:41:07,020 --> 03:41:09,779
paws levels in this case tsunami who you
got

2696
03:41:09,779 --> 03:41:14,220
I got Ramses you got room I think I
think the play is to pick an eliminated
player and they've got they've got no no

2697
03:41:16,680 --> 03:41:19,919
pressure remaining or anything they're
just there for the glory maybe other

2698
03:41:19,919 --> 03:41:24,109
players you know they'll let the let the
rains be handled by the eliminated ones

2699
03:41:24,109 --> 03:41:27,449
sure you want to show off because you
never know what's gonna happen to the

2700
03:41:27,449 --> 03:41:33,319
shuffle you wanna prove that you can
play through not you know no pressure
