A Tri-Modal Video Genre Classification

Deep Learning 2020 - Goals

0. Regroup for data loading- Friday
1. Audio - LSTM(Extract features manually) and 2d CNN(CNN Extraction for features)
2. Video - 3dCNN(Exists) , Tune hyperparameters etc.
3. Maybe text (optional)- Train CNN,Transformer,LSTM.
4. Speech to text

If you have trouble with torchaudio, these 2 solved my issues:
!apt-get install sox libsox-dev libsox-fmt-all
!pip install git+git://github.com/pytorch/audio
